    <p>We have a new #1 this week folks. Expert roster construction and an eye for undervalued veterans have catapulted Art to 4-1 with the most points in the league. He absolutely disemboweled Pigs on the 7th this week in a show of force that has owners around the league fretting. See below for a couple of the quotes our ace reporters got: “He shanked the McCarthy pick, and his team is still stacked. What the fuck.” “He can’t keep getting away with this. It doesn’t even make sense.” (This was said in reference to Art’s affinity for Tua and Dolphins tight ends. People forget Jonnu storyline from last year) The committee must eat it on this one. We were way too low on Art’s roster. His preference for established to aging veterans exposed one of the blind spots in our model. Deebo “Curtis” Samuel and George “Of the Jungle” Pickens are both widely renowned jackasses who were jettisoned by their former teams. Between this and generally criminal-adjacent behavior, they were severely undervalued. Pickens and Samuel are currently WR6 and WR7 respectively. Admittedly, Pickens will regress when CeeDee returns but this is absurd value given they cost Art a combined $16. For reference, Ger spent $15 on Russell Wilson. Furthermore, he grabbed Javonte Williams for $4. Williams was a complete bust in Denver and retards (like the committee) assumed Jaydon Blue would ascend to the Cowboys RB1 role. Instead, Williams looks like the player people expected when he was a much- ballyhooed prospect coming out of the 2021 draft. Williams is the RB4 through five weeks. And we would be remiss to not mention Darren “Sharper” Waller. Waller was a retired coke fiend rapping for fun and has come off the shelf to return to peak form. With 16 points in each of his first two starts, Stewed C is fuming. Between these under the radar pickups and solid play from Tua, Herbert and the Jacobs/Breece combo, we fully expect to see Art in the mix at the end of the year. Now it’s early in the year to revisit best and worst draft picks but it’s too fun not to do it.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-best-pick"><span class="callout-label">Best Draft Pick:</span> Javonte Williams. $4 for an elite RB in a high-powered offense is unheard
of. Credits in the chat for Javonte.

    <p>Alright given Art’s section was a bit of a novel, we’ll try to keep this one brief. Haters might have been expecting us to eviscerate JB after an awful week. He scored only 60 points against Scampi’s porous defense as Scampi waxed his balls by 50 points. However, there were some mitigating factors. Penix, Bucky and Bijan are probably three of his top four players and all were out of the lineup. Penix and Bijan got their bye out of the way early (credit them), while Bucky was nursing a stubbed shoulder or something. In any event, all three are expected back this week. Additionally, Jauan “Brandon” Jennings is getting close to a return to provide JB with another viable receiving option. The committee couldn’t overreact to one bad week. JB faces off with his longtime rival Team Daniel this week and we fully expect him to return to his winning ways.</p>

    <p>This was a very tough call between Scampi and Ginny Sack so we grouped them together. Both teams have one legitimate quarterback, elite running back play, solid receivers and a lot of questions at the QB2 position. The committee is partial to Carson Wentz, but he injured his shoulder this week and there are questions about whether JJ McCarthy will return as starter after the bye. We have to weigh that against Scampi’s spray and pray strategy of rostering Marcus Mariota (elite), Kirk Cousins, and Anthony Richardson. In Ginny’s favor, Christian McCaffrey looks as good as ever. He is 3rd in the league in targets and catches which is just obscene for a running back. Additionally, Tetairoa McMillan and</p>
<p>Drake London look the part as tall, light-skinned monsters snatching footballs out of the sky. In Scampi’s favor, it’s just ridiculous he got Jonathan Taylor for $34. Taylor is the only RB with more points than McCaffrey so far as he powers the Colts offense which leads the league in EPA per play. Scampi also claims James Cook, who’s the RB4 through five weeks. Between the RB play, Travis Kelce’s mild resurgence and Sam Richard Darnold finally living up to the hype the Jets fans dreamed of all those years ago this team is ready to roll. The deciding factor between these two squads came down to Kyler Murray’s health and Kyren Williams’ enthusiasm for fumbling. Murray is to be “evaluated” this week after getting hurt against the Titans. It goes without saying that if Kyler gets hurt, Ginny is fucked at QB. Pigs on the 7th already rosters Jacoby Brissett so he wouldn’t even be able to grab Kyler’s backup. That plus Kyren Wiliams now having the 2nd most fumbles of any RB since the start of last season costs Ginny the 3rd spot in the rankings.</p>

    <p>The committee feels rewarded in its Work Ass faith after a dominant week 5 performance. He put up a league-leading 167 points powered by the Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Emeka Egbuka duo. If you’ll recall last week the committee said, “Having said that, this team might be carried by its Ohio State wide receiver duo. Emeka Egbuka and Jaxon Smith- Njigba are studs.” Almost like Nostradamus sits on the committee or something, right? Chase Brown continues to suck cock, failing to surpass 50 rushing yards again this week. But that probably won’t matter if Bo Nix and Trevor can carry their week 5 performances forward. Very promising stuff out of those two in wins over the Eagles and Chiefs. Additionally, we have to give Work Ass some serious flowers for the Jake Tonges play off the waiver wire. Mac Jones gave Tonges 11 targets, and he translated that to 13.6 points this week. Tonges might be a mainstay in the Work Ass lineup until George Kittle can return.</p>

    <p>You could argue the committee is being stubborn continuing to rank Stewart so high, but the underlying metrics remain strong. We can’t overreact to things as trivial as wins and losses. Stewed scored the 5th most points in the league this week but still caught a loss against Life with Derrick. It should be noted Derrick was winless and threw the kitchen sink into his gameplan this week to prevent falling to 0-5. The committee still has faith in Stewart’s roster. Hurts and Stafford continue to prove one of the top QB duos in the league (QB5 and QB6), Garrett Wilson is the WR5 as he rekindles his college chemistry with Justin Fields, and Quentin Johnston may have been the best sleeper pick in the entire league. So how is he 1-4? A combination of lineup mismanagement and bad luck have put Stewed behind the eight ball in the playoff race, but our model still puts him among the best teams in the league. Committee skepticism regarding the coaching for this team is the biggest question mark going forward.</p>

    <p>Another 1-4 team making moves. The Monster’s team is much better than his record. Baker is balling like it’s 2017 at Oklahoma, Jake Ferguson is the TE1, Diggs in channeling his inner retard into being good at football again, and the Achane-Jeanty duo remains very explosive. Jaxson Dart played like prime Jake Fromm and he still put up 17 points. That’s extremely promising for CMGC’s rest of season outlook. CMGC took out all the frustration from his 0-</p>
<p>4 start on Ger this week in a 148-97 thrashing. One angle of the TV broadcast showed CMGC doing the Allen Iverson stepover against Ger and then calling him a “stinky nigga”. It’s unclear how the league office will respond to such antics, but it made for quite a spectacle. CMGC also saw a bit of a boost in our models this week due to rostering Ted Waters. As one of the most reliable backups in the league, it would be a sight to see him execute Kyle Shanahan’s offense. Some have compared the idea to Daunte Culpepper in 2001.</p>

    <p>These three ogres are being grouped together due to their team composition. Each has very good QB play with highly questionable rosters elsewhere. The committee brought in a consultant named ChatG to compare and contrast these teams but holy shit was he retarded. He was fired. Each of these teams has two of the top ten QBs in points per game so far this year. Team Daniel- Jayden and Dan Jones SDZ- Dak and Drake Maye Pigs- Mahomes and Homo Dubz Mahomes and Jayden have the highest upside of the group but Dak and Drake are probably the steadiest. Let’s assume these three groups are a wash. Skill talent is where we see tiny separation among this group. Team Daniel has Jahmyr Gibbs who is by far the most explosive and best player on any of these teams. Gibbs is the RB5 so far. Kincaid is the TE2. And Team Daniel’s receivers are a combination of decent players with Brian Thomas leading the way. Sweeney Deez and Zaukas ha a bunch of bad starters at skill positions. Chase is still the best but with Browning under center he’s liable to throw up a dud every other week. Pollard, Dobbins and Charbonnet get touches but they’re about as uninspiring a trio I’ve seen this side of the Yankees pitchers. And the Evan Engram-Chig Okonkwo duo at tight end. Committee members audibly laughed when that crew was brought up. Pigs on the 7th has an interesting mix. Rico “Gathers” Dowdle just went for a million, but he’s expected to keep riding pine when Chuba Hubbard is healthy. Jaylen Waddle actually looks like a player again with Tyreek gone. And Terry McLaurin is returning from injury in short order. Overall, this crew just lacks some juice in the eyes of the committee. This group of teams was hard to differentiate and probably all top out as playoff teams who can’t realistically win the championship. We do have to give Pigs credit for snagging Jacoby Brissett. If Kyler misses any time, he could demand a fortune from Ginny Sack in a trade.</p>

Nobody is really sure if his plan was to have two quarterbacks who would sleep through the whole season, but that’s the way things are going so far. Geno Smith is 22nd and Cam Ward 31st in total QB points through five weeks. There’s just no feasible way to construct a great team with QB play that bad. In the non-retard division (everyone except AI Coke), Sweeney. is 2nd to last in total points so far. This is cause for concern as this team had high playoff hopes. If he’s going to reach his goals, it is going to be on the back of Puka Nacua and Quinshon Judkins. Puka continues his dominant start with his 5th straight game over 17 points to begin the year. And since Judkins stopped beating up women and ripping off liquor stores, he’s been able to channel his criminal tendencies into productive football. Judkins has three straight games with at least 13 points and 95 scrimmage yards. Rhamondre Stevenson should probably just be guillotined though. He is so not good enough to warrant 10 fucking fumbles since the start of last year and not be playing in the Indian Football League.

CJ Stroud had his best day of the year, Justin Jefferson and Carson Wentz built some chemistry and Courtland “Hal” Sutton continues to perform like a WR1. Now he’ll have to attempt the climb from 0-4 to the playoffs without his workhorse RB Hampton. We reached one of Derrick’s chief competitors for comment and he posited that, “Going from 0-4 to the playoffs is akin to Batman escaping the pit. Nobody can do it, but if anybody can it’s Derrick.” High words of praise. The committee still hates his QBs more than most, but we have to admire the depth Derrick has built.

Double digits in every week and the QB21 overall. NOT BAD. The trouble is most of his other players are busts save for Travis Etienne. Keon Coleman has fizzled after some initial juice. He has four straight weeks of single digit output. Calvin Ridley didn’t get off the bus until this week so maybe there’s hope going forward.

Having said that, Amon-Ra and CeeDee is probably the best WR duo in the whole league. CeeDee has been complaining about a “high ankle sprain” but word out of Gorlock’s camp is that he’s acting like a huge pussy and needs to “rub some dirt on it”. If the training staff can motivate CeeDee to get back out there ASAP, this ranking could change in a hurry. Amon-Ra is the WR2 and has been routinely sniffing the endzone while Justin Fields continues to corner the bad at real football but awesome at fantasy market. Have to give Fields credit for his consistency in this regard. With Aaron Jones out, the running back situation here is just beyond dismal.

    <p>Should he be in prison? Deported? Head shaved at least? It seems AI Coke has all but given up on the season already. He didn’t even bother to set his lineup last week, leaving Aaron Rodgers (bye week), Mike Evans (hurt), and Tucker Kraft (bye week) in the lineup. This handed Team Daniel a free win. Preposterous behavior. “But Mr Committee sir, his team is so bad it wouldn’t have mattered!” Save that nonsense for a communist who’ll believe it. Rachaad White with 21 points on the bench. Put him in there. Dalton Schultz with 8.5 points on the bench. Put him in for Kraft. Jayden Higgins with 5.2 points. If he’d put all three in, that’s an additional 35 points and he outscores The Jackson Brownes this week. Many among the league are calling for punishment. Some ideas that have been floated include no McSwiggans for a month, one- on-one afters with a spewer of the commissioner’s choice, or wearing an eyepatch indefinitely. Given his ineptitude, we will assess his roster weekly until the product improves.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-best-pick"><span class="callout-label">Best Draft Pick:</span> Tucker Kraft for $4. Great Value.
Worst draft pick: Saquon for $59. He’s been fine as the RB9 but mostly a touchdown-
dependent mongoloid. Committee expects better.</div>
