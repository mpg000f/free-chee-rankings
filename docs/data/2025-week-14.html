    <p>The committee is embarrassed to admit that we implemented the incapable of reading strategy last week and fucked up several scores. We assure you it won’t happen again. Going forward, we will assume Scampi wins every game because he’s been such a wagon it’s almost not even worth checking. Scampi put up a pedestrian 119 points but calmly dispatched Derrick. After being without a QB2 for much of the season, Scampi has now fallen into both Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota as options. His depth is so strong he kept Jaylen Warren on the bench this week. Warren is a top-20 back on the season and would be an RB1 for half the teams in the league. Scampi has such an embarrassment of riches that Warren gets to ride pine and scratch his balls as the team rolls to victory anyway. There is some concern about Jonathan Taylor’s dogshit performance but can’t overreact to one week. Scampi can clinch the one seed next week if he takes care of Ginny Sack. Bookmakers have that as a close one with Scampi -135 on the moneyline.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-pick"><span class="callout-label">Predicted Finish:</span> 1st seed. Scampi is too good, he’s all but certain to win at least one of the
next two to clinch. Even if he loses both there’s a miniscule chance of Ginny or Art catching

    <p>Ginnald moves up to 2nd after he throttled JB this week. He’s now 9-3 with a 69% chance of a top-3 seed. His QBs may be retarded but at least he has two now. Shedeur had a couple nice throws and Monroe et al are crowning him the next Mahomes. That’s mostly besides the point. Ginny will continue to lean on McCaffrey and Kyren as he hopes to get Drake London back healthy. While Michael Wilson has filled in admirably, he’ll need London for the playoffs. Speaking of Wilson, he’s had 25 targets in the last two weeks with Marvin Harrison Jr sidelined. Jacoby Brissett and Wilson have such a strong connection, some on the committee are predicting Wilson remains the WR1 even when Harrison returns from his bout with appendicitis. Just an elite job working the wavier wire by Ginny. It’s a shame both Tetairoa and Bowers have abysmal QB play because they look like future all-pros for Carolina and Las Vegas.</p>

    <p>We have to admit this was a startling week for Art. He barely squeaked out a win over Obama even as George Pickens looks like a homeless man’s Calvin Johnson (that’s a compliment). But when the committee ran their deep dive on Monday, concerns mostly faded. Justin Herbert and Tua were both on bye while Josh Jacobs was hurt. To pull off the win without these three was fairly impressive. There’s not much left to be said about Nine. He’s simply not an NFL QB right now. The Vikings would be better off signing Vinny Testaverde off the street than rolling out McCarthy again next week. Art doesn’t necessarily have any of the most elite players this season, but at full strength his lineup is well-rounded enough to compensate. He’ll take on Sweeney Deez and Zaukas this week. SDZ will be a sizable underdog in that one as his team has tailed off a bit as of late.</p>

    <p>The league has been buzzing about the trade Pigs executed for over a week now and how could we not be given the performance that Jahmyr “On His Horse” Gibbs put together Sunday against the Giants. That trade catapulted Pigs from a decent playoff team to legitimate title threat and it was only possible because of his incredible foresight in acquiring Jacoby Brissett. Let’s revisit that transaction. It was September 4th, the opening day of the season and it was a stormy morning. The Zombie Room was buzzing at Bloomfield and rain pounded the windows. Pigs was perusing the waiver wire after what he deemed a successful draft when it hit him. He was better off rostering Brissett than Derek Carr. He scooped Brissett off waivers without knowing two months later it could lead to a franchise altering trade. That trade enabled Pigs to defeat Work Ass in a game with massive playoff implications this weekend. A loss would have Pigs in 7th place, firmly on the playoff bubble with the other 6-6 teams and only narrowly above Stewed C. The 49.9 point outburst from Gibbs allowed him to hold off Work Ass and move himself into 5th place. With one more win, Pigs will be a near lock for the playoffs. That output by Gibbs was good for the 14th-best game by any running back this century and the best this season, narrowly edging Jonathan Taylor’s 48.1 point output from a couple of weeks ago.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-pick"><span class="callout-label">Predicted Finish:</span> 9-5 and likely 4th place. He finishes with the two worst teams in the

    <p>Just the epitome of brutality for Work Ass. One week after taking down CMGC in a titanic clash, he has to turn around and get his team back up for a monster showdown against Pigs on the 7th Rank. His team just wasn’t quite able to get off the mat and slumped to 10th place after the loss. As you can see from this ranking, the committee remains confident in this squad. Bo Nix will be back next week and he’ll need Nix, JSN and Chase B to lead the boys to two wins to close out the year if there is to be any hope of the playoffs. Sitting at 5-7 but with strong likelihood of winning the tiebreaker against his competitors, Work Ass does have a path. He’ll most likely need to win the next two against Sweeney. and Gorlock. That part is manageable. Then he’ll need Team Daniel and Ger to each lose one of their last two or JB/Obama to lose both to create an opening in the top-8 for him. Our model has the most likely playoff scenario for him as Ger and Team Daniel both lose week 14 to create an opening. 27% chance Work Ass makes the playoff. Empires have been built on worse odds.</p>

    <p>In a heated rivalry clash, SDZ was able to ride the trucking of Emanuel Wilson and Dak Prescott to a narrow victory against Sweeney. This victory seemingly clinched a playoff berth for him, so he can now relax and slug some tomato beers in celebration. If everything breaks right, including a monster December from Jamarr Chase, perhaps this team could contend for the title, but we don’t really see it. The running backs aren’t good and he’s scrapping his WR2 situation together with chaps like Greg Dortch and Tez Johnson. However, his trio remains dominant.</p>
<p>As you can see, Pigs on the 7th acquisition of Gibbs helped to overtake SDZ’s vaunted trio. However, the committee is choosing to blame the scumbag Chase for getting suspended. Without that suspension, the trio would reign supreme.</p>

    <p>The CMGC chants that once rang out loudly and frequently along the streets of Hoboken have mostly been extinguished over the past month as CMGC has lost two straight and four of five. The coaching staff just wasn’t able to coax the necessary consistency out of an obviously talented squad. It still baffles us to look at the talent on this squad and see a 4-8 record. He is 2nd in the league in points for. It’s the type of stuff we haven’t seen the 2008 Chargers. Baker is now dealing with a shoulder injury just as Dart projects to come back from a concussion this week. The stars just couldn’t align for the team this year, but he’ll have a chance to play spoiler down the stretch. First, he has a get-right game against the winless Senior AI Coke Twins. Next, he’ll have the opportunity to decimate JB’s hopes and dreams in the season finale. If he’s able to win both, there’s a tiny chance at the playoffs. The model gives it a 2.3% chance.</p>

    <p>Back in September, we talked often about how this was mostly a four man team and JB would go as far as those horses could carry them. Well Bucky Irving (horse #3) missed most of the season with some mickey mouse injury and Michael Penix (horse #4) has suffered his 5th season ending injury since high school. JB’s aspirations are now riding on Josh Allen, Bijan Robinson and a motley crew of black receivers. With two games against teams hungry to spoil his season on tap, rumors are that the mood at JB HQ is nervous. We spoke to a source at Carpe Diem who said nobody from JB’s camp has stepped foot in there in over a week. The only contact they’ve had with his camp was a suspiciously large order for delivery. Our source said the order was 5 raw heads of lettuce and a 12-pack of Coke. Safe to say things are not going well at North Willow.

Now, the model still does him a 17% chance, but he’ll need to put together two of his best gameplans of all time if he’s to beat JB and Scampi in back-to-back weeks. Perhaps Kenneth “Kenny G” Gainwell and Kyle Monangai can provide enough supplemental scoring to lead Stewed C back from the brink. The committee is openly rooting for him to take down JB this week to muddy up the playoff picture going into the last week of the regular season.

Derrick’s high scorer this week was the 30-year-old Kareem Hunt who peaked in high school. Marvin Harrison and Stroud’s health remain in doubt and it seems likely Derrick will finish out the year with five wins at best. Tough scene.</p>

    <p>At least he’s not Senior Coke, right? We actually should give Gorlock credit for fielding a legitimately nice lineup this week and essentially eliminating CMGC from playoff contention. Amon-Ra did the thing, Hunter “Hungry Hippo” Henry ate up yards against the Bengals, and Tyrod Taylor provided a reasonable facsimile of QB play that Justin Fields never could for the Jets. This trio along with 20 points from the Falcons defense carried Gorlock to 121 points, which was his 2nd highest point total of the season. Credit him for continuing to coach his guys even after the season was lost. That’s the type of culture building win that could carry over into 2026.</p>

    <p>The question everyone was waiting to have answered. Did he set his lineup? He did in fact set a full lineup. Plan the parade. His highest scorer in that lineup was Colston Loveland, but still it was a full lineup. Nothing broke right for Senior Coke this year and he was the source of much debate in the committee room. Was this bad luck or organizational incompetence? The committee leaned slightly toward bad luck as injuries to Purdy, Evans and Tucker Kraft seriously hampered any runway Senior Coke had. Having said that, his draft was pretty terrible. He overspent on Saquon and K9. Between that and the injuries, this team was terrible. It was exacerbated by having a Joe Judge level human as GM, but still.</p>
