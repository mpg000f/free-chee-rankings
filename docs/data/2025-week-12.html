    <p>In a matchup of the top two teams in the league, Scampi left zero doubt. The craziest part is it was mostly a mediocre day by much of Scampi’s roster. Darnold was bad with 6 points. James Cook had only 8. None of that mattered because Jonathan “Tishman” Taylor went for a fucking million. Taylor had the 6th best half-ppr performance by a running back in the last 10 years. One of those top five was Taylor himself in 2021 by the way. The man is so clearly the best player in fantasy football. After the game, one of our reporters had the privilege of asking Taylor about his performance and he responded, “I almost felt bad. Getting into their 2nd level was almost as easy as putting back a 30 piece from Chick Fil A.” Wise words from the best player in the league. Taylor is down to +500 for NFL MVP. At 9-1 and a point differential similar to the 07 Pats, Scampi is an overwhelming favorite to be the 1st seed in the playoffs. Our model pegs it as a 83% chance for Scampi. With Marcus Mariota clearly going to be a serviceable QB2 going forward, this team is unbelievable. The only worry for Scampi is if he’s peaking too soon. Can Taylor continue this tour de force for another two months?</p>

    <p>Art ran into an absolute buzz saw this week against Scampi, but we remain confident this team will be a force to be reckoned with come playoff time. He put up a respectable number even with Pickens and Javonte on bye. However, there were some positive developments for Art. Jerry “Jones” Jeudy finally had a breakout game with 16.8 points on 12 targets. This is a good sign for Art as he was lacking receiver depth with Jeudy underwhelming for much of the year. In addition, JJ “Nine” McCarthy put up 17 points despite playing like a glorified Zach Wilson. It’s encouraging that McCarthy can have a solid output while looking like mud. Some scholars (not me but others) have compared it to a white Justin Fields situation where he’s terrible at real football but can be pretty good for fantasy. Food for thought. With a matchup against the reeling Team Daniel up next, it’s likely Art of the Deal gets back in the win column and moves to 8-3 next week.</p>

    <p>The committee continues to look like a crew of Nostradamus, George Orwell and the Oracle of Delphi for its faith in CMGC. The committee is supposed to be unbiased but a chorus of CMGC chants actually broke out in the committee room during the 1pm slate due to the elite play of De’Von Achane and Jaxson Dart. Achane thought Sunday would be a good day to remind everyone that he’s in contention for the fastest man alive. He torched Buffalo for two long TD runs and put up 37.5 points. After Sunday, Achane is now the RB3 behind only Jonathan Taylor and Christian McCaffrey. Jaxson Dart probably suffered a concussion on Sunday but given his general temperament we doubt he misses much time. Even if he does, Joe Flacco will sling puck for CMGC just fine. In his 7 starts, Dart is averaging 23.3 points per game. That is tied with Josh Allen for 2nd best in the league on a per game basis. Dart is a stud. If only the Giants would fire Daboll. Perhaps they can just demote him to running the hot dog cart in the 2nd concourse for next year. At 4-6, CMGC sits with only a 44% to make the playoffs but if he gets in, he might be the only team Scampi truly fears. Our model has him at a 12% chance to win the title despite his low playoff odds.</p>

    <p>Another 3-6 who the committee has had faith in showed out on Sunday, annihilating Stewed C and dooming him to contend for a bleached tuck in January. Even with quarterback play that looked like me, Work Ass rolled as his vaunted trio of receivers continued to dominate. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Rome Odunze and Emeka Egbuka. These are three of the top ten receivers in the league on a points per game basis this year and Work Ass paid something like $14, a bag of mulch and a BK gift card to acquire them. With George Kittle back in tow, he’s close to firing on all cylinders as he looks to make a playoff push. Work Ass faces off against CMGC next week in a battle of the committee’s two favorite teams. CMGC will enter that one as a slight favorite. After that Work Ass gets to face Pigs, Sweeney., and Gorlock to close out the year. He’ll need to go at least 3-1 to be in the playoff mix. Those last three constitute a fairly easy schedule for Work Ass. 41% chance to make the playoffs based on the model.</p>

    <p>Much to the chagrin of some, SDZ just continues to stack wins as he marches toward a playoff berth. At this point, we assume everyone is familiar with the legendary trio SDZ rolls out every week, right? Perhaps not. Let’s deep dive the top trios again to make sure.</p>
<p>As you can see SDZ’s trio remains elite with the 2nd most points in the league behind only the unstoppable Jonathan Taylor. Having said all that, Dak and Jamarr didn’t even play this week and SDZ was able to field a winning roster due to elite his waiver wire work. Five of his starters this week were scooped up off the waiver wire. Troy Franklin, Christian Watson, Theo Johnson, Tez Johnson and Mac Jones were all waiver pickups by this front office. Credit him for identifying early that Troy Franklin and Theo Johnson were poised for 2nd year breakouts. But the committee’s favorite pickup is by far Mac Jones. Since SDZ picked up him up prior to week 5, Jones has averaged 16.7 points across six starts in relief of Brock Purdy. Can you guess who dropped Mac to pick up Jeremy McNichols? The Jackson Brownes. What a freak. He dropped a QB who’s averaged more points than Michael Penix since then for a braindead running back with one positive play the entire season (not a joke he had a 60-yard TD run in week 3 and nothing since). Can you imagine? In a league that values quarterbacks like Gong values ketamine, JB dropped Mac Jones for McNichols. Next up he takes on Obama.</p>

    <p>Pigs got waxed pretty good this week through no fault of his own. CMGC just took a chainsaw to his defense, and it was fruitless to protest. Having said that, the committee likes how he has put this team together. Pigs correctly identified that Mahomes and H-Dubz were undervalued in the preseason and they have delivered big time for him. Mahomes is QB1 and Williams is QB8 in points per game on the season. Two top-eight QBs provide Pigs with a high floor while he has tinkered around the edges to improve his team. Rico Dowdle has been a godsend for a team that was lacking high-end playmakers after James Conner and Tyreek Hill were lost for the year, and Terry McLaurin continues to battle injuries. Since Dowdle’s breakout in week five, he is the RB4 overall. He is behind only Jonathan Taylor, Christian McCaffrey and De’Von Achane. Is he kidding? In addition to Dowdle, Jaylen Waddle has taken his game up a level since Tyreek’s injury. Since week five, Waddle is WR6 in total points. Those two will need to keep it up for Pigs to reach their goals. Given the injuries he has faced, most on the committee will consider a simple playoff berth a successful season, but rumors suggest Bloomfield is aiming higher.</p>

    <p>The committee knows we’ll receive some serious pushback on this one but hear us out. With Kyler Murray being moved to IR and Jonathan Gannon publicly throwing his support behind the highly regarded Jacoby Brisset, Ginny’s hopes might be pinned on Tyler Shough. Shough played some clean ball on Sunday, but it was against the Panthers. The committee needs to see more before we become believers. It’s a tough situation because Ginny’s skill talent is as good as anyone’s. McCaffrey continues to dominate as always; Kyren Williams has a knack for finding the end zone and Drake London is in the midst of a hot streak with four 20+ point games in his last five. He even has some solid tertiary pieces like Romeo “Crennel” Doubs and Tyrone Tracy Jr. At 7-3, he’s got a 93% chance to make the playoffs so Ginny has some time to potentially work out a trade or farm another QB prospect because right now the committee and the model are not optimistic about his title chances.</p>

    <p>Imagine talking all that shit and then getting waxed by Parker Washington. Some of the most Mickey Mouse stuff we’ve seen since the inception of the league. He’ll now move to 6- 4 and at risk of missing the playoffs entirely if he doesn’t pick up. Ger, whose team JB was thoroughly mocking this week, is now one game back of him in the standings. Things are looking down for this team. Penix continues to play like a more retarded version of Tua while Bucky Irving can’t seem to get healthy and Bijan Robinson is now getting touches vultured by the Mike Alstott wannabe Tyler Allgeier. Still, the reason he’s not cooked is because if all things are firing, this team still hast the potential to be threatening. Josh Allen hasn’t even been playing well and he’s still averaging 23.3 points per game. Jauan “Brandon” Jennings has worked himself back in nicely and is averaging 7 targets per game over the last four weeks. And perhaps most importantly, Keenan Allen won the Shiniest Head in Los Angeles contest for the 3rd time in the past five years. Unfortunately, the model still has him at a 86% chance to make the playoffs.</p>

    <p>With a massive victory over JB this week, Ger moves to 5-5. Despite his abysmal start to the season, he now has a 48% chance to make the playoffs. The schedule isn’t terrible, but he does get Scampi next week. Jonathan Taylor is on bye so he’ll have a better chance than most. The intuitiveness to play Parker Washington and Davis Mills this week is just unbelievable by Ger.  They call him Parker because he spends most of his time parking cars for the Jaguars, but these last two weeks he’s put up 29.4 points. It’s unclear if Ger can keep this up as Stroud expects to return quickly and Spencer Rattler has been benched for Tyler Shough. However, even sneaking into the playoffs would be a massive victory for Ger. He burned $60 on Nabers (injured) and Russ (zoo animal) at the start of the year. Some would say his drafting needs work but his in season moves have been excellent. In particular, the patience to wait for a TreVeyon Henderson breakout appears to have bore fruit. Henderson cribbed two long touchdowns on Sunday to score 27.5 points.</p>

    <p>This was a tough one because the model straight up does not like the rest of these teams. But Sweeney. was the best of the bunch. Let’s start with the bad. Cam Ward and Geno Smith remain two of the saddest sacks of shit we’ve ever seen when it comes to fantasy QBs. Geno is 24th in total QB points YTD and Cam Ward is 31st. Not good. Now let’s get to the reasons why he’s still 10th in the rankings. Puka is back and Nico Collins seems to have revived himself. Obviously, both have suffered injuries but on a points per game basis, they are WR3 and WR17. When you mix the big play ability of Tee Higgins in with that, you’ve got some real upside. Alone that wouldn’t be enough to warrant this ranking, but Judkins and</p>
<p>McBride put him over the top here. McBride is averaging 14.1 points per game which is TE1 by a mile and higher than any tight end has averaged since 2022 Travis Kelce. Credit him, right? Judkins has cooled off recently, but we still believe in his production. At 3-7, he’s likely cooked for playoffs (model gives him a 3% chance), but this team could play spoiler down the stretch.</p>

    <p>I think it’s just about time to put a fork in Stewed’s season. After getting thrashed by Work Ass, he sits at 3-7 with a 5% chance at the playoffs. A combination of bad luck, injuries and peaking too soon really did him in. Derrick Henry for instance. He has finally fallen off some after defying father time for years. Henry is the RB17 so far which is fine but not exactly living up to his $45 price tag. Davd Montgomery similarly has been just fine but has seriously ceded ground to Jahmyr Gibbs in the Detroit backfield. The main reason Stewed C has been competitive is because of two outstanding QBs. Hurts and Stafford are both top-6 in QB points per game so far and have carried Stewed C. While Quentin Johnston has forgotten to catch and Xavier Legette tries to read, Stafford has thrown touchdown after touchdown and Hurts has thundered his way into the endzone time after time. If we were to do analysis of top duos in the league, these two would be right up at the top. Can only imagine how much some would hate that stat. Overall, it’s time for him to pack it up and try to get a win in December to avoid last place.</p>

    <p>We were actually starting to feel pretty bullish on this team before Jayden Daniels’ injury. Somehow, Daniels wasn’t placed on injured reserve so maybe he can come back? That would be a miracle for Team Daniel because he put up a poor 86.8 points this week. Three of his starters combined for zero points. DJ “Can’t Ball No” Moore, AJ “Sleeps in a” Barn and Ollie G the Second combined for zero. It begs the question: are they retarded? DJ Moore did not graduate from Maryland and we have it by good authority he ate Grubbs burgers for much of his college tenure. Ollie G the second did in fact graduate (credit him) but has been known in certain circles as a DUI enthusiast. Safe to assume both are in fact retarded. Based on our research, Barner did not meet the threshold for retarded. We have to give Team Daniel a nice hearty pat on the back for attempting to execute the rarely seen but highly praised triple tight end strategy. It did not work, but the committee appreciates the effort.</p>

    <p>It was ugly but Derrick pulled out a win over the cellar dweller Senior AI Coke. Derrick’s highest scorer was the Jets defense. That’s the type of stuff we haven’t heard since the heyday of Rex Ryan. Derrick’s team is like a bunch of 6th men in basketball. None of the players are terrible and, in a pinch, could start for most teams in the league, but the supposed stars have been pedestrian at best. Injuries robbed him of Omarion Hampton to start. And then guys like Justin Jefferson and Alvin Kamara haven’t delivered. Jefferson is outside the top ten WRs and Kamara is outside the top-30. With those guys not producing and Bryce Young doing the broccoli-haired midget routine, there just isn’t much of a chance for Derrick to make a late push. At least Marvin “Benjamin” Harrison Jr. has shown signs of life with Jacoby Brissett under center.</p>

Tre Tucker looks like he has a size 23 neck and twelve felonies on his rap sheet. We also wanted to rip Dillon Gabriel but he kind of balled out on Sunday so we’ll give credit where its due. The hope for Obama lies in Joe Burrow. Burrow was seen on the practice field this week which means the Bengals have 21 days to activate him. If Obama gets Lamar and Burrow back in the lineup together, it might not matter that the rest of his roster is worse than Rutgers football in 2016.</p>

    <p>This team’s star power always surprises me when I first take a peak. CeeDee Lamb, Amon- Ra and Jordan Love are absolute ballers. But then we have to look at Justin Fields and a stench so strong sweeps over the committee room that once or twice some people have even vomited. After a one-week reprieve where he dominated Cincinnati’s hapless defense, Fields returned to his Black Nathan Peterman impersonation. He had 42 net passing yards and piloted an offense that was the first since at least 1940 to win with fewer than 170 yards and zero turnovers by the opponent. Truly groundbreaking stuff from Fields. Gorlock has a 0.8% chance at the playoffs per our model.</p>

    <p>On the weekly roulette wheel of will AI Coke set his lineup, the league lost this week. Mike Evans (on IR) and Brock Purdy (has Connor’s toe) both did not play and were in the lineup. We suppose he deserves some credit for at least moving Tucker Kraft out after he was lost for the season with a knee injury. It’s too bad because playing Jayden Higgins may have made the difference in getting him his first win of the year. Debits in the chat.</p>
