    <p>I mean he has to be kidding. After one off week, Derrick returns to his steamrolling ways by obliterating the Cap Stoppers. Ja’Marr Chase might not be able to read One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish but he can certainly rack up some yards. This one was over by midnight Thursday after Chase dropped 52.9 points against the Ravens. Oddly enough, this was the most points anybody had scored in a fantasy game since Ja’Marr Chase shaved my head on January 2nd, 2022. The rest of Derrick’s team was just above average this week.</p>

    <p>Of the famous Sweeney-Zaukas-Deez triumvirate, Deez is by far the strongest. He put up a strong defensive performance to silence the Tishman this week and move to 8-2, all but clinching a playoff spot. Deez had such disdain for Tishman’s team he didn’t even bother starting a second receiver opting instead to leave an injured Amari Cooper in his WR2 slot. Some might even say the move shows Bloomfield is emanating a bit of cockiness as he rides a six-game win streak. The most mind-boggling part of this is that Homo Williams and his cum guzzling pals have been atrocious. This team is being led by the Mixon-Conner- Cement Boots trio.</p>

Gorlock is firmly in the playoff mix and the outcome to his season will likely come down to is he hot at the right time. Type of analysis you pay me for right?

Stewed may use bizarre motivational tactics on his team and post suspect memes in the locker rooms, but he gets these guys to produce.

    <p>The Stoppers ran into Life with Derrick this week, so we don’t hold the loss against him. Might as well be playing the ’72 Dolphins. The main reason for the downgrade here is the QB play seems to be deteriorating. Baker’s points declined for the 4th straight week as he struggles to adjust without Mike Evans and Chris Godwin in the lineup while Aaron Rodgers continues to increase his weekly dosage of DMT to potentially lethal levels. Having said that, the De’Von Achane and Jahmyr Gibbs duo have get away from the cops speed.
