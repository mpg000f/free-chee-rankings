    <p>Derrick stays on top after a hard-fought win over Hand me this Piss. He entered Monday night needing Chris Godwin to not outscore Derrick Henry by 11 points. And then Derrick did Derrick things. There was good news and bad news for Derrick this week, but on the whole, it was probably more beneficial than detrimental to his season-long outlook. Starting with the bad, Justin Fields was benched by Mike Tomlin in favor of Russell Wilson. It was shocking mostly because Russell Wilson is among the most hated men alive today. Given his performance Sunday, Tomlin might have had a point. Having said that, Wilson significantly raises George Pickens’ ceiling for the rest of year. Pickens had his best game of the year going for 19.6 points vs the Jets. Additionally, Nick “Markakis” Chubb returned to the lineup for the Browns and saw 14 touches. With The Rapist tearing his Achilles, the Browns might even field a real offense going forward and Chubb should figure into that greatly At the midway point of the regular season, we’re going to take this time to torch (and congratulate) some gentlemen for some of their elite draft picks two months ago.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-draft-steal"><span class="callout-label">Draft Steal:</span> Derrick Henry for $32 is absurd in hindsight. Henry is RB1 and a top 3 overall

    <p>Beef Stew choked away what was a near certain win because of Jayden Daniels’ injury. Nonetheless, he stays at 2 with a 5-2 record. This ranking is assuming Daniels will be fine and miss no significant game action. With a healthy Daniels, this team is loaded. As predicted, the Drake Maye hype train is leaving the station with the rankings committee in the conductor’s cabin. Maye has exceeded 20 points in his first two NFL starts and after watching the all-22 from the Jacksonville game Sunday morning, the committee sees superstar potential. Working behind an offensive line comprised of orcs and throwing to pigs with hair, Maye was still able to produce. When you add that to the mix of Kamara, Barkley, and Bowers you’ve got a league winning roster. Also, how furious is John Mara today after seeing Saquon’s revenge game? 176 on 17 carries is typically good.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-draft-steal"><span class="callout-label">Draft Steal:</span> Maye (obviously) is a steal and a half for $9. We must highlight Brock Bowers
here though. Bowers (Kev’s hair) has been the TE2 so far trailing only George Kittle and Stew
got him for a few Chuck E. Cheese tokens and 35g of sand ($3).</div><div class="callout callout-draft-bust"><span class="callout-label">Draft Bust:</span> He’s not awful but Garrett Wilson at $40 is subpar value by our algorithm. He’s

    <p>A big move this for the Stopper of Cap as he jumps up 5 spots. The committee was moved by his utter annihilation of Sweeney. The lineup Monroe Street threw out there this week belonged in a zoo. Heading into Monday night, he had 15.06 points and not one of his 6 players had exceeded 6 points. Justin Tucker and Justin Herbert’s heroics on Monday were able to get Sweeney. over 50 points. But the reason Cap Stoppers moved up so much is that he’s shored up any weaknesses in his lineup and Achane’s effectiveness is about to go through the roof with the return of Tua. Khalil Shakir is also a crowd favorite.</p>

    <p>Sansa tumbles even further this week after a bit of shellacking at the hands of Deserves to be Shot. His team will be fine but the injuries to Jonathan “Tishman” Taylor and Derek “Dicaprio” Carr are killing him right now. Spencer Rattler, a one-time contestant for the ugliest man alive, isn’t going to cut it we’re afraid. The good news is that Kyren Williams and Brian Robinson Jr are back and humming. Each exceeded 70 yards and found paydirt this week. It’s hard to chirp because the committee would’ve done the same thing but Jets defense flat out stinks.

    <p>Not bad right? Pigs dominated Stew this weekend even with a pitiful performance from Matthew Stafford. Stafford had 4.96 points which is pretty much what Stone Smart threw up on Monday night. Yes, that’s a real human being. We’re not sure 21 points from Dicker the Kicker is all that replicable but at 5-2, this team is well positioned to make the playoffs (roughly 95% of our simulations have him in). Jixon has been unstoppable, carrying a dogshit CJ Stroud on his back for the Texans. Meanwhile, Amari Cooper and Najee “Kamala” Harris both saw huge boosts to their stock with changes in their quarterback this week. Bloomfield ought to be celebrating this week between its fantasy outlook and decimation of the pickem league. Credit to Pigs.</p>

    <p>Shot has kind of just been floating around the middle of these rankings for a while now. He’s got a decent team. Good quarterbacks, good running backs, and Brian Thomas Junes. However, it leaves you wanting more. We’ve got him with a 70% chance of making the playoffs, but that’s mostly because the competition falls off a cliff after #9 in these rankings. Everyone below 9 has either dug themselves too big a hole, or fields a team that even ketamine crew would turn their noses up at. Josh Allen has been objectively quite good as the QB4 in both average points and total points, but he’s hardly been the destroyer of worlds Shot envisioned when he spent $65.</p>

runs like Ger.</div><div class="callout callout-draft-bust"><span class="callout-label">Draft Bust:</span> He only spent real money on 7 players, and all are valuable assets so “bust”

    <p>Crazy week for Tua. First and foremost, actual Tua is back. When the haters and the pussies said Tua but what about your health, he responded “Well, how much risk do we take when we get up in the morning to go drive to work? Get into a car crash, I don’t know.” We on the committee applaud Tua for shutting down this liberal narrative about “concussions” and “CTE”. Let the boys play. Some were absolutely fuming about it. Best part is he said he’d rather jump off a bridge than wear a guardian cap. On to other news, The Rapist is dead. He is out for the year.

    <p>Easily. Work Ass got rolled this week, but the algorithm still thinks this team is pretty good. If we remove the results portion of the model and only run the team evaluation, Work Ass actually ranks 5th. The problem is he sits at 1-6. Jalen Hurts has been picking it up recently, Drake London is WR9, and Dontayvion Wicks has an elite name. His playoff prospects are even lower than Marvin though.

    <p>Tishman falls back one spot after the rise of WHERESTUA. Tishman is similar to Work Ass in that if you remove the results portion of the model and focus solely on projections, he would actually rank 9th. Credit to him for weathering the storm. At 2-5 he’s in a better position than some other teams to make a surprise run in the second half. Having said that, the model still gives him just an 8% chance of touching foot in playoffs. Jordan Love and AJ Brown are back in addition to Tyreek getting a massive boost from the return of Tua this week. Tishman’s team looks scary.

    <p>Honestly, there’s room for him to move even higher. Could one argue the committee’s model cares too much about quarterback performance? Absolutely. But we would argue back that a team with Will Levis is just asking to be laughed at. With Cooper Kupp back in the fold and the Giants RB situation locked down, Ger has some second half upside. We have him with an 18% chance to make the playoffs. This is significantly higher than some of the other teams in this tier. That mostly stems from the fact that he’s already banked 3 wins while others (Work Ass and AI Coke) have 1. We’ll be monitoring the front office in Austin closely.

    <p>Back-to-back weeks at 16. Good for him. Javonte Williams might be nasty but otherwise this team is hit or miss. Even his highly priced QBs Stroud and Kirk ($102 combined) have been QB18 and QB24 so far in points per game. That’s not gonna cut it. It doesn’t look like Davante “Eric” Adams reuniting with his old QB is going to save the season either. The committee would like to recommend a new coach. He might not be available for a week but one of the great managers of our time, Aaron Boone, will soon be in his offseason and the committee views him as an outstanding choice to turn this team around.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-draft-steal"><span class="callout-label">Draft Steal:</span> It has to be Javonte. After a slow start, he’s RB16 in points per game over the
last 4 weeks and looks to continue ascending against a weak Broncos schedule.</div><div class="callout callout-draft-bust"><span class="callout-label">Draft Bust:</span> I mean let’s be reasonable. Zamir White isn’t a human. Gotham spent $10 on
this guy, and he is the RB65 halfway through the season. You’re better off with Walter
Hudson in the backfield.</div>
