    <p>After advancing to 12-1, there is a legitimate discussion to be had if this is the greatest team of all time. Admittedly, his legacy will be determined in the playoffs but at 12-1 with a point differential like the OKC Thunder, we are putting Scampi on GOAT watch. Even as Jonathan Taylor has slowed down recently, James Cook and Davante Adams continue to hum while AJ Brown picks it up. Marcus Mariota has been just as good as the committee expected replacing Jayden Daniels. The team is so stacked Kirk Cousins and Jameson Williams are stuck riding pine. Scampi has now clinched the 1st seed and there is nothing that could happen next week to knock him from his perch in the power rankings. Credit Scampi, Gallo, BG and all the rest who helped put together this masterpiece of a season.</p>

    <p>Gin took the loss this week against his sometime nemesis Scampi, but it’s hard to hold it against him. With Art of the D losing to SDZ, Sack can likely clinch the 2nd seed next week with a win. Tyler Shough has been surprisingly clean with two 18+ point games in his last three. When coupled with elite playmakers like Bowers, McCaffrey and Kyren that might be enough to put Sack in contention. We’re still skeptical of the Shedeur stuff but we do have to give him credit for telling the media they are illiterate douchebags. He still needs Drake London to slap some duct tape on his calf and get back on the field for the playoffs.</p>

Scampi. There will be 5 or 6 teams entering the last week of the season with a 9-4 or 8-5
record. In theory all of them are in the mix to be as high as the 2nd seed and as low as the 6th
seed. With McCaffrey and Tmac on bye with London questionable to play, it’s gonna be a
close but we expect him to win and be the 2nd seed.</div><div class="callout callout-best-pick"><span class="callout-label">Best Move:</span> Carson Wentz hour.</div>

    <p>Whispers from some well-placed sources tell us Bfield was blasting Chief Keef and ripping blunt in celebration of his playoff-clinching win over Gorlock this past weekend. As former Chief enthusiasts ourself, the committee can hardly blame his passion. The timely trades and gradual improvement Pigs has shown over this season has been astounding. When Tyreek and James Conner went down with season-ending injuries many on the committee thought he was cooked. Pigs trusted his scouting department to uncover value and it has certainly paid off. Rico Dowdle’s emergence more than offset the loss of James Conner. Waddle stepped up his game after Tyreek was lost. And most importantly, he rostered Brissett all year. Brissett has finished as QB10 or better in five straight weeks and allowed Pigs to trade for Gibbs. With Mahomes, Brissett and Gibbs operating at full throttle, this team has the 2nd highest odds of winning the title per our model.</p>

    <p>Huge win for SDZ this week. With a heroic effort from Drake Maye on Monday night, SDZ was able to squeeze past Art of the Deal to get to 9-4 and avoid inclusion in the glut of teams at 8-5. Christian Watson has been an elite late season add for SDZ and has somewhat helped offset the loss of JK Dobbins, but the loss of Dobbins is what really crushed belief of a title run. Any hopes of a run now likely come down to can the vaunted trio that haunts Monroe’s nightmares (Maye/Dak/Chase) combine for 80+ points per week. If not, SDZ is cooked.</p>

    <p>His receivers are among the worst crop the committee has ever laid eyes on and for some reason he’s rostering Max Brosmer.

The worst performance in that timeframe was of course the immortal Nathan Peterman game of 2017.

    <p>Stewart Cink. He missed out on an opportunity to sneak into the playoffs with last week’s evisceration at the hands of JB. Sitting nearly 100 points behind CMGC, he’ll have to settle for spoiler in week 14. Actually, that probably won’t happen either because he’s going up against Scampi’s buzzsaw.
