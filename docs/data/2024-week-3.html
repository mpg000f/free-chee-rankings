    <p>Stewed C drafted a fairly decent squad. Saquon has performed great so far even after that disastrous drop on Monday night. Couldn’t imagine what he felt like after that one right? But the real reason Stewed is number one is because he got the steal of the draft in Alvin Kamara for only $15. Kamara is the #1 scorer in the league through two weeks. It’s also looking like Brock Bowers will prove to be CHEEEEAAAAPPPPPP at his $3 price. The balding tight end has 17 targets through two weeks in the Raiders’ Gardner Minshew led attack. If there is one area of concern for this roster, it is quarterback. Jayden Daniels has been solid so far but relying so heavily on a rookie and could prove the downfall of Stewed C. Drake Maye has yet to see the field and the performance of rookie quarterbacks outside of Daniels is downright abysmal. League HQ suspects Stewed C is concerned about peaking too soon and being ruined come playoff time.</p>

    <p>Hand me the P is fielding a well-rounded roster so far. It seems he learned from his past mistakes by getting two high level quarterbacks this year. Historians still remember the Drew Lock debacle of 2022. The Dak and Mahomes duo should carry him, but what separates Hand me the P is Jordan “George” Mason. As long as Christian McCaffrey is out, Mason will perform like an RB1. Rumors suggest the front office at Bloomfield was popping bottles when they heard McCaffrey’s Achilles was made of paper. Couldn’t imagine dropping $77 on a guy with no Achilles. And while the Jets may stink, Breece “No Neck” Hall is living up to his billing as a fantasy superstar so far. Certain members of the league office believe he bears a striking resemblance to a resident of Monroe Street. Makes you think. We fully expect Hand me the Piss to be in the mix for the title come January.</p>

    <p>Some members of the rankings committee made a case that Sansa should’ve been ranked first. Others chose to dock him for employing known felons like Rashee Rice, so he falls to 3rd. Similar to Piss, Sansa has a very well-rounded team with no clear holes. Sansa’s work in the draft was unbelievable. He secured 3 good starters for a combined $20 in Zay “Ereck” Flowers, Rashee Rice, and Brian Robinson Jr. Meanwhile, you’ve got other front offices spending $32 on injured Hawaiians like Puka. What a freak. Even Sansa’s depth looks great with playable options like Christian Kirk, Chone Figgins, and Courtland Sutton on the bench. In 73% of our simulations, Sansa secures a top 4 seed. The one area of concern for Sansa is tight end. Dalton Kincaid came into the season with a lot of hype but has yet to see many targets.</p>

But with Bryce Young’s benching he has acquired the ever-valuable 3rd starting QB and trade offers have been pouring in. The league office fully expects he’ll receive at least WR2 value in return for Andy Dalton.</p>

Jamarr “Vincent” Chase had better perform if he wants that new contract. Derrick Henry and David</p>
<p>Montgomery ought to eat touchdowns for their respective teams. And with injuries to CMC and Deebo, George Kittle should be a focal point of the offense in San Francisco.

    <p>Tough schedule so far for Marvin. He’s 6th in points for but sits at 0-2. It’ll be a tough climb to make the playoffs but with the talent Marvin has assembled we think its possible. Lamar Jackson, CeeDee Lamb and Marvin Harrison form a formidable trio for this squad. And getting Jeremiah Kendrick Dobbins for only $2 is highway robbery. It’s been rumored the GM had Chick-Fil-A catered for the whole front office this Monday as a show of resolve. Middle management has been working the waiver wire extra hard for the team after the gesture. I think the concern for Marvin is the quarterback position. He has nobody to play behind Lamar unless Aidian O’Connell overtakes Gardner Minshew is Las Vegas. While some of us in the league office still view Wentz as a franchise QB, it seems unlikely he’ll beat out Mahomes in Kansas City due to political reasons. Perhaps they’ll find some sleeper on the wire to play as a second QB. We’ll be watching this one closely.</p>

Baker and Rodgers are both legitimately good but maybe not top ten quarterbacks. ETN might lose his job because he’s an ogre who can’t stop fumbling. And as good as Rashid Shaheed has been, can he really keep this up the whole season? If Achane and Gibbs keep getting 20+ touches a week, the committee feels confident this team will be in the playoffs.

    <p>If we ranked him any lower, the committee feared bomb threats at the league office. Let’s start with the good for (Sweeney.). Nico “Fort” Collins looks capable of being the overall WR1 this year and has laid waste to the Colts and Bears secondaries to start the year. The injury to Jordan Love hurts, but Jayden Reed is a breakout star. If he has a quarterback who can get him the ball, he’s going to pile up some points. The committee’s concern lies in the fact that (Sweeney.) has two quarterbacks with limited upside. Justin Herbert is great but with James Joseph Harbaugh committed to running the ball and a lack of receivers, it seems unlikely he’ll be throwing for 300 and 3 frequently. And then Daniel Jones. This man has been employed by the Giants for 6 football seasons now and has never been better than average? At best? Jones has to know this is his last year in New York and we fully expect him to throw in the towel sooner rather than later so he can start touching afters 3 times a week. Deebo Samuel injury not great either.</p>

Our projections still have Work ass making the playoffs in 47% of simulations so there’s a lot of opportunity there. The potential for Trey “Cedric” Benson and Braelon Allen to get more touches as the season progresses would be a boon for this team.</p>

Jayden Daniels seems allergic to giving Terry McLaurin the ball in a position to succeed. 6 catches for 22 yards last week by McLaurin? Joey in boots could get 22 yards on 6 catches. Kyle Pitts remains the biggest tight end disappointment in modern history and despite multiple attempted surgeries this offseason Najee Harris was unable to remove the cement boots from his feet.

    <p>The Rogues should arguably be higher but their management team has rubbed some on the committee the wrong way, so we decided to stick it to them.

Chimney Jose Stroud and Kirk Cousins are a far better duo than what the other teams at the bottom of the rankings are rolling out. Furthermore, Davante “Samuel” Adams seems to still be near his peak as he shredded the Ravens last Sunday. Our biggest concern for this team is running back. The Rogues picked up Antonio Gibson off the wire and he’s immediately the best back on the team. Zamir White sucks at football. The Raiders should be relegated from the NFL for thinking that guy is a starting running back. Despite many attempted trades from the Rogues’ corrupt GM, he has yet to find a willing trade partner.
