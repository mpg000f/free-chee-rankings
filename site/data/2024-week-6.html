    <p>THE STEWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Stew got outstanding news today with the leaks that Drake Maye will be starting this weekend. Just as Gardner Minshew exits, Maye enter for Stew. Timing couldn’t be better. The committee’s models favored Maye as the best quarterback in the draft this past year due to several factors. Size, arm strength, and skin pigmentation were among Maye’s highest rated attributes by our scouts. If Maye works out, there really won’t be a hole on this team. Jayden Daniels and Saquon should continue to make Stewed HQ very happy.</p>

    <p>Sansa was able to put up 149 even without Jonathan Taylor in the lineup. This team is so deep, Rashee “Piece of Shit” Rice can be dead in a ditch and Sansa doesn’t miss a beat. He bounces back from a tough loss last week by crushing the Gotham Rogues. Having said that, the injury to Derek “Dicaprio” Carr on Monday night gives the committee pause. With Carr expected to miss multiple weeks, Spencer “Ugly Retard” Rattler will be pressed into action for the Saints. Credit to Sansa for scooping Rattler off the wire as insurance.</p>

    <p>It was a close call between Derrick and Gorlock for 3rd, but the committee couldn’t get past the herculean upside of the Ja’Marr Chase &amp; Derrick Henry duo. Over the past 3 weeks, those two wildebeest have combined for 149.5 points. That’s damn near 25 points per game each. If those two keep it up, Derrick is going to be very hard to beat. There are some weaknesses, like none of his quarterbacks are awesome, but with 3 legitimate starters it’s hard to chirp. You’ve got teams out here starting Will Levis. The biggest concern might be the fact that he’s starting a man named Emanuel Wilson. Apparently, Emanuel attended college at Fort Valley State University. Has to be cap, right?

    <p>This team is nasty. The differentiator between Derrick and Gorlock was that the committee deemed Justin Jefferson and Joe Burrow as slightly smaller threats to society than Ja’Marr Chase and Derrick Henry. But we certainly believe Gorlock could win the title. With Geno “Atkins” Smith and Burrow playing at an elite level, Gorlock boasts arguably the best QB duo in the league to pair with his star level skill talent. Rumors suggest the ownership at the Avalon has hired Mikey, Sadie and their crew to sing opera to Gorlock’s front office as a treat for elite management so far this season.</p>

    <p>Piss takes a tumble from the top spot this week after a hard-fought loss to fellow Bloomfield inmate Alexander’s Unreal Team. Even still, the fundamentals of this roster remain strong. There are no glaring holes with plenty of room for upside. For instance, Patrick Mahomes has yet to break 18 points in a game this year. And yet some people call him the “GOAT”. The committee personally would rather field Jay Cutler but to each their own. It also appears Evan Engram will be returning to the field this week to give Piss a boost at tight end.</p>

    <p>Some less-renowned rankings systems like those out of Portland and Beijing might point to Marvin’s 0-5 record as proof of a poor team. The good news is the scholars that build our models don’t think like that. Marvin is essentially a tossup (48% win probability) this week against Sansa (2nd best team in the league). Does he need to fix his defense? Certainly. He’s given up 82 more points than any other team so far. Do we believe Hudson Street has a plan? Tough to say. Marvin has some ballers and AOCs time has come. With the single best player in football so far carrying his team, Marvin cannot be ruled out for making a late run to the postseason. It would be a first in league history if he does make it after an 0-5 start. Moneyline this week.</p>

    <p>You could make a strong argument for Sweeney. over Cap Stoppers here but the injury to Nico “Phil” Collins could prove disastrous. League insiders reported yesterday on MSNBC that Nico will be placed on IR and miss at least 4 weeks. Both these teams are clear playoff teams but may lack the juice that some of the true title contenders above have. Another distinction the committee saw between these two was the Stoppers’ stealthy acquisition of Tucker “Carlson” Kraft in the dead of night. Kraft, well known at the Green Bay BK for ordering 4 or 5 Quad Stackers at a time, is projecting as a top five tight end for us the rest of the year. Injuries and criminal activity have depleted Green Bay’s receiver corps and Kraft will be a key cog for Jordan Love going forward. Having said that, Sweeney. isn’t far behind and that’s why we lumped these two together. The committee will admit defeat on Daniel “Boone” Jones. We thought he was an abysmal fantasy choice but even without Nabers this week he produced. Credit to Sweeney.</p>

    <p>The coaching staff of this team is really pulling off an all-time balancing act here. The team has mostly played like shit and yet they sit at 3-2, well within striking distance as we approach the midway point of the season. They’ve just been waiting, assessing, plotting strategically. It’s been heard that the plan is to continue to squeak out wins for the next month or so and then really turn it on. At that point, Josh “Tim” Allen and Bijan Robinson will stop playing like cock and proceed to put up 27 per week (each). Then Chase “Emmett” Brown will be so good that he’ll force the Bengals to become a run first team.

    <p>Work Ass got on the board this week with an annihilation of Tishman. It’s not exactly what you call a “statement win”, but after starting 0-4 Work Ass will take what he can get. The part that intrigues the committee is the Joe Flacco piece of things. Flacco dropped 26 to carry Work Ass to victory alongside Drake London. Overall, we’re not sure this team has enough to climb its way back into the playoff race. It would probably take quite the effort from Rich Man’s Desmond Ridder and DeVonta Smith. Dontayvion Wicks does present the potential for serious upside, however. With Christian Watson and Romeo “Dickhead” Doubs out, Wicks has been eating targets from Jordan “Spieth” Love.</p>

    <p>Deez was victorious in the intra-Bloomfield duel this past week weekend riding Caleb Williams and a string of solid but unspectacular performances from the rest of his roster. He had 5 gentlemen with between 8 and 14 points. That’s just great coaching. At 3-2 AUT is far from cooked, but a lot of his players are just sturdy veterans without much upside. Najee (boots), Amari (rapist QB), Kyle Pitts (brain damage) and Stafford (Ricky at left tackle) all have factors outside their control that limit their upside for the rest of the season. In 74% of our projections AUT finished between 8th and 11th place at the end of the season. Perhaps if Jonathan “Herb” Brooks gets healthy, that can provide a spark for this team.

    <p>This team isn’t very good, but he has a few things going for him. CJ “Chester Julius” Stroud and Kirk “Dirk” Cousins are humming right now. Just an absolute masterclass of QB play from those two this past weekend. It was so good in fact that Jon Gruden and his buddies were seen on IG live doing afters and breaking down the film. Type of stuff you love to see. Furthermore, it seems like Roschon Johnson and Bronny James are getting more involved for the offenses in their respective teams. On the flip side, Gotham doesn’t have one running back who’s a true workhorse and had Tutu Atwell in his lineup last week. Maybe he can give Aaron Judge a call?

He then wakes up at 5:30 CT, has a bowl of oatmeal and scans the landscape. We have it on good authority he couldn’t pass up Dare “Chief” Ogunbowale and so drops Darius Slayton for him.
