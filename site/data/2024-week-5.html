    <p>Piss stays at #1 this week despite the loss. Our projections like his remaining schedule and give him a 78% chance of finishing top three in points for at the end of the season. Having said this, should the committee really overreact to one arguably fluky loss to Sweeney.. We would recommend that Patrick Mahomes picks up the pace at some point. He has now gone 4 straight games without breaking 20 fantasy points. That’s 9 straight games below 20 fantasy points dating back to last season. That is more than twice as long as the next longest streak of his career. Chat, is Mahomes cooked? It remains to be seen but the committee is concerned. Piss really needs Evan “Darius” Engram to get healthy so he can stop streaming tight ends like Elijah Higgins and Brevin Singleton.</p>

he’ll be a difference maker for Piss heading into October.</div>

    <p>Gorlock takes a big jump this week. The main differentiator for him is Kenneth Walker III. After missing the last two games, Walker came in Monday night and looked electric. He was dicing up the Lions defense like it was cocaine in the McSwiggans bathroom. With solid QB play and some the trio of Jefferson, Walker and Cook the committee could see this team playing well into January. Credit to Gorlock for executing his draft strategy to perfection. He bet big on a few guys and thus far, they have all delivered. We heard one member of the league office at Soho compare this team building job to Dave Gettleman in his prime.</p>

improvement there.</div>

    <p>After seeing Rashee “Sidney” Rice’s knee blow up on Sunday, our initial reaction was that might be a death blow to Sansa. But further analysis shows he has amassed the type of death that would make John Calipari’s 2015 Kentucky team jealous. Rice goes down, but Sansa still has 4 legitimate guys who could start on several teams in this league. Sansa did eviscerated by Life with Derrick this week. Giving up 148 points is a tough look for this coaching staff. Some are asking if the midseason name change will propel Life with Derrick to previously unforeseen heights. Sansa will bounce back with what some media members are calling the “the free win” against the Gotham Rogues next week. Due to the close proximity of the two franchises, it could be viewed as a rivalry. The committee knows better than that though. The difference between these two franchises is vast it would be tantamount to calling Rutgers and Raritan Valley Community College rivals.</p>

    <p>What was once thought to be a mildly bad team is turning into a juggernaut. Derrick (with the name change) demolished Sansa this week in dropping 148 points. Is that generally good? Trevor Lawrence is still not good, but it’s hard to find much else wrong with the squad. Derrick “Future HOF” Henry looks like me approaching Johnny Rockets when they have a BOGO deal. We have David Montgomery as a top ten running back for the rest of the season based on our metrics. And Justin Fields continues to get more comfortable in Pittsburgh. The concern here is depth should Derrick suffer any injuries. We’re not sold Emaunel “Woodrow” Wilson or DeMario “Buster” Douglas are particularly good backups. But we’re picking nits here.

    <p>Marvin is a textbook example of why the rankings committee relies on things like science and intuition. 300 years ago, we have it on good authority cavemen were using wins and losses to judge the success of their fantasy teams. Here in the 21st century we’ve ascended beyond such primitive measures of quality. Marvin has 464 points for this year. That is 6th most in the league and yet he has zero wins. His hopes of making the playoffs are dwindling (we give him roughly a 7% chance), and yet the underlying pillars of this team are elite. Lamar Jackson, CeeDee “On the” Lamb, and Aaron “Julius” Jones have been studs for this team and will do everything they can to pull it out of the gutter. We’d like to highlight the Nostradamus-esque ability of Marvin to predict the Dolphins would need to start Tyler Huntley and rostering him accordingly.</p>

    <p>Stop the cap had a one-week bump before falling back to the middle of the pack. Can Baker really carry this team? The Stoppers’ success may hinge on the answer to that question because Aaron Rodgers looks cooked. Washed. Overrated. Antivaxxer. Putting up 9 points against Bo “Downs Syndrome” Nix at home is fairly disqualifying to the committee. The good news is the Stoppers still pulled out a victory to advance to 3-1 by beating HWYT. Rumors suggest HWYT was putting back Ketamine with the AI Coke Twins. Our investigative unit is still looking to verify. On the bright side though, Jahmyr “Joe” Gibbs is one of the most electric backs the league has seen. He moves faster than Papi’s jaw at afters.

    <p>We still don’t like his quarterbacks very much. Boone and Hoover have limited pass catching options and coaches who want to run the ball which limits their upside. But then Sweeney. goes out there and puts on an absolute clinic on Sunday slicing up Hand me the Piss to the tune of 127 points. Nico “Phil” Collins looks like the second coming of Megatron. So maybe the committee is just wrong. We thought D’Andre Swift should be flipping burgers in a Waffle House in South Carolina, not putting up 165 yards on the Rams.

    <p>Shot pulled out a much-needed victory on Monday night.

One neighbor even reported a hole punched in the wall of the lobby. “He won’t even break 100!” Can you imagine? Now the committee thinks Shot has some serious concerns. His receivers are still the worst in the league by every available metric that we have (projected yards, catches, touchdowns, bench press, meal plans, etc).

We’ll check with the folks at 23andme and follow up. Jalen Hurts has been playing like Desmond Ridder in real life but fantasy wise is still a top ten QB in fantasy so far. Beyond that, this team is approaching cooked territory. Anthony Richardson, DeVonta Smith, Tank Dell and Christian Watson are all nursing injuries which leaves Work Ass reliant on stalwarts like Zeke (Washed), Jahan Dotson (Not Good) and Braelon Allen (Kinda Like Him). After a shellacking at the hands of the Gotham Rogues (unthinkable), Work Ass is in dire need of a win this against HWYT.
