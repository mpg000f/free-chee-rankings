<div class="intro"><p>The committee would like to apologize for the delay in this week’s rankings. Several members of the committee had prior commitments on Tuesday leading to the delay. Additionally, the committee has decided to implement a new practice of ranking every team from scratch each week. In the past, we’ve allowed our previous opinions to cloud the rankings each week. Going forward, we will start each week anew like the Nepalese government. Without further ado:</p></div>

    <p>We knew this team was awesome after week 1, but the continued emergence of some role players in week 2 only solidified the committee’s belief. Josh Allen and Michael “Huge Cock” Penix were awful in week 2 and JB still rolled to 2-0. Allen is obviously the best player in fantasy football, but the committee is really high on Penix too. Atlanta has a plethora of weapons he can get the ball too and his du rag is top notch stuff. While it may not be the best QB duo in the league, it’ll be in the mix if Penix provides a reasonable floor. Jim Nantz was quoted as saying “Bucky and Bijan might be the shiftiest guys I’ve seen since prime Orleans Darkwa.” The real reason JB secures the 1st overall spot though is the depth he seems to have at receiver. Keenan Allen has back-to-back games with at least 60 yards and a touchdown. It’s clear Justin Herbert and him are still boys whereas gayboy Caleb was no fan of Keenan. Alongside Keenan, Juwan “Jack” Johnson also might be a steal for JB. With 20 targets through two games, Spencer “Ugliest Man” Rattler certainly seems to be a fan.</p>

Anyone who’s heard the nonsense Willow spews late night is probably familiar with Elic.
Two years ago, Stanford played Colorado on a Friday night. This was 2023 so the year
FanDuel was pumping out “2019 LSU vs 2023 Colorado. WHO SAYS NO???” graphics. Pure
retard hour but beside the point. Ayomanor dropped his nutsack on Travis Hunter’s head
that game. He shredded Hunter with 13 catches for 294 yards and 3 touchdowns as
Stanford roared back from a 29-0 deficit to win in OT. The highlight was Elic snatching the
ball off Hunter’s helmet for a touchdown. It looks like he might be a player in the NFL too.</div>

    <p>Big Gin. The Ginster. He had a plan all along and it looks like it’s going to work out well. Week 2 was rough, but the committee likes to look at the bigger picture. Are we concerned about records at this time of year? Of course not. We’re looking at potential. Gin’s base lineup of Drake London, Tracy McGrady, McCaffrey, Kyren and Bowers is top tier stuff. Kyler will play. That left him two gaps in his lineup which he’s arguably filled? Russ appears to love Wan’Dale Robinson. Robinson has 18 targets in 2 weeks. If that continues, he’ll be a reliable flex option. But the real reason for our confidence in Ginny Sack is Carson “Palmer” Wentz. JJ McCarthy has (charitably) looked like if Zaukas played QB for Riverdell. We’ve spoken with key assets inside the Wentz camp and he’s viewing this as an opportunity to resurrect his career. We fully expect a Wentz win streak and for him to push hard to remain the starter through the rest of 2025.</p>

    <p>Work Ass seemed to approach his draft with a very specific angle attacking Caucasians and lightskin gentlemen to fill out his roster. Eleven of fourteen men on his roster fit this bill and this roster is damn good. JSN hasn’t scored yet and it doesn’t matter because he looks as good as the buffalo tenders from Sonny Bongo’s. Pearsall, Egbuka, and Rome Odunze round out what might be the best and deepest receiving corps in the league. The committee is pretty torn on the effectiveness of Bo Nix and Trevor Lawrence in real football, but in fantasy we fully expect Sean Payton and Liam Coen to scheme them up some touchdowns. We even like the bench flyers he’s taken. Cam Skattebo may have already overtaken Tyrone Tracy in the Giants backfield. If that’s the case, Work Ass will have options on tap for his lineup or to trade for a big fish. Rumors suggest at least one owner is looking to move a marquee name for some real depth.</p>

Corum might finally be breaking into Kyren’s stranglehold on the Rams backfield. With 5
carries for 44 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, it’s clear Corum can play. If he gets even
25% of the touches out of that backfield, he’ll be a real factor for 2025. Credit.</div>

A lot of his players aren’t particularly exciting, and JJ McCarthy hype is kind of in the tank right now after Sunday’s performance plus the injury news. Nonetheless, Art has got some players. Tua averages more than 17 points per game over the last 3 seasons. That puts him right around QB12 in</p>
<p>PPG. We don’t care how much people hate on him because he generally produces. Deebo, the subject of many “fat retard” and “washed” memes this summer, has 18 targets and double-digit points in both weeks to start the year. Josh “Ol Reliable” Jacobs has touchdowns in eleven straight games. And Javonte Williams has gone from “why the fuck is he the Cowboys RB1” to potential league winning player in a month. Justin Herbert might be Art’s only player whose play elicits genuine excitement so far and it doesn’t matter because this is a well-rounded roster with some potential depth.

Mahomes, despite the Chiefs offense looking like Monroe’s clogged toilet, is QB4 through two games. Tyreek and Waddle both slapped up double digit points in week two. James Conner is a workhorse who’s addicted to the endzone. The team absolutely has flaws, chief among them starting two old Commanders when Jayden Daniels may miss time, but they’ve also got some talent.

    <p>There it is. Week 2 was the masterpiece envisioned by this front office when he assembled this squad. Dak throwing for a million. Drake Maye looking like the evolutionary version of Tom Brady. Ja’Marr Chase eating targets like Bloomfield eats mash burgers. Even Pollard and Dobbins look entrenched as RB1s for their respective teams. The vision is there. SDZ has got some real challenges though. Evan Engram might just be washed so he’s going to be working the wire for a real tight end. Engram has been outsnapped by Adam Trautman. I could line up 2 headshots of random white guys and you wouldn’t have any confidence which one was Adam Trautman. The real problem for this team is Zach Charbonnet. Charbonnet has 27 carries through two weeks is sufficient volume to be viable. However, he turned 15 carries into 10 yards in week two. That’s .67 yards per carry. That’s Ricky in high school type numbers. If Charbonnet can’t prove more effective soon, there’s a good chance Kenneth will dominate that backfield.</p>

    <p>We can already hear the uproar from protestors outside the league office with this ranking. “Burrow’s dead and he’s still ranked 7th?! Grab the pitchforks and torches.” Let’s calm down. In 2023 when Burrow was hurt, Browning averaged 18.75 points per game. Credit to Obama for ensuring he had Browning as insurance. Joe Burrow in his career averages 19.4 fantasy points per game. We expect limited drop off in fantasy output going from Burrow to Browning. As an aside, Burrow is cooked. Can’t be grouped with Allen and Lamar anymore. All he does is eat mud and get injured. Threw 45 touchdowns and couldn’t even make the playoffs last year. Not my franchise QB. Elsewhere, Tyler Warren continues to look like a monster and Jakobi Meyers is eating targets (up to 22 through two games). Travis Hunter sucks at football, but we’re confident Obama has a backup plan there.

    <p>Sunday evening, the committee received an anonymous text message that said “How do my nuts taste you retard?”. One can only assume that came from Ger. After we eviscerated him and Russell Wilson last week, he came roaring back with a monster performance. He put up a league leading 158 points this week, led by 34 from Goff, 33 from Nabers and 31 from Russ. Is that typically a good trio to have? Travis Etienne continued his RB1 activities as well and this team looks a whole lot scarier than it did a week ago. Obviously, Russ won’t continue like that, but he doesn’t have to. He just needs to feed Nabers the rock. Ger has reasonable hope that Spencer Rattler can be a viable option if and when Russ is benched for Dart. Furthermore, he’s got high upside options like Keon Coleman and DK Metcalf to complement his studs. He’s now 2-0 with the 5th most points and has Rashee Rice returning next month. There’s a legitimate chance we’re looking at a title contender. But let’s hold our horses. This Giants outburst could very easily be a mirage, and Russ will return to looking like Aldana next week. That would be devastating for Ger. He also drafted Kaleb Johnson for $5. Johnson is so bad a player he has negative fantasy points through two weeks. Ger’s QB strategy may not be to the committee’s liking but if it works, we’ll give credit where it’s due.</p>

Hurts game manager crew is loving this right now waiting for Brown to blow up and punch Hurts in the throat for lack of targets. Forget him for a moment. Davante Adams looks rejuvenated catching passes from Matthew Stafford. With 21 targets across two games, it’s clear Stafford will feed him the rock. And then there’s Scampi’s running back room. Jonathan Taylor and James Cook and both in peak form, decimating defenses for chunk gains while Jaylen Warren has cornered the Pittsburgh backfield and kept the idiot rookie Kaleb Johnson on the bench. Between Kelce and Andrews, we imagine one of these geezer tight ends will start playing good, right? Stashing Mariota on the bench is also a veteran move by Scampi as Jayden Daniels health looks to be in doubt. As longtime holders of Mariota stock, the committee will be even more bullish on this team if he plays for any extended period of time.</p>

He stole Stafford for cheap and found an incredible sleeper in Quentin Johnston, but beyond that the team is mostly underperforming. Derrick Henry had a poor week two, but he’ll easily bounce back. Devonta, GW and David Montgomery all need to pick it up. Some, not me but some, on the committee wonder if Stewed’s performance in week two was significantly affected by the absence of their coach. The head coach of Stewed had a little bit of a bender and ended up booting his brains out much of the weekend. Hard to draw up a gameplan when such activities are taking place. Long term, we buy this team, but he can’t afford another loss if he&#x27;s to climb out of the 0-2 hole.</p>

While the Cookie Monster Golf Cart seems to be running smoothly, the same can’t be said for this team. He’s 0-2 with the 2nd fewest points in the league so far. Let’s start with the good. Baker and Achane have been as advertised through two weeks. Can’t complain about the performance of those two. Also, Jake Ferguson and Kyle “Busch” Pitts provide a functional TE platoon to work with. Other areas leave much to be desired. Flacco is a good stopgap, but he’s not a top-20 and probably not even a top-25 QB on a weekly basis. The sooner Dart overtakes Wilson, the better the outlook will be for CMGC. Additionally, whether it’s Jeanty’s fault or the offensive line’s fault, Jeanty’s production has been underwhelming. We need to see more from the 6th overall pick to justify the hefty price tag CMGC paid for him. Ladd McConkey will be fine but it’s frustrating to see him as the WR3 on his own team through two weeks. The assumption was he would eat targets when in reality Quentin J and Keenan A have split the production so far. We would still bet on this team to make the playoffs.</p>

And Amon-Ra shook off a poor week one to take it out on the Bears in week two. Credit to him. After that, things get dire pretty quick. The committee watches a lot of football and knows some fairly obscure dudes. We had never heard of this Zavier Scott fellow who is now Gorlock’s RB2. Further research uncovered that he’s a 26 year old who played 6 years of college at UConn and Maine after high school in Germany. In his final year of college at Maine, he had a vaunted 805 total yards and 5 touchdowns. Genuinely I don’t know how that guy is in the NFL. Gorlock is rostering him because Aaron Jones was placed on IR. Justin Fields is also out with a concussion which is bad news for Gorlock but at least he’s got Tyrod Taylor on board.</p>

We believe we deserve some credit for so openly revealing our bias against them. We don’t need to rip them for the 2nd straight week so let’s focus on the positives for this team. Justin Jefferson is very good at football, and with Carson Wentz relieving McCarthy for the foreseeable future, we expect Jefferson to see a huge target share and get back to his normal monster stat lines. Additionally, Alvin Kamara is just a beast. He’s playing on a dogshit team and continues to produce. The upside may be limited but he’ll be a productive guy all year. Lastly, Omarion Hampton and Marvin Harrison are good football players. Their production has been iffy so far but stay the course.

Nico Collins needs to produce more. He’s the WR1 on a superstar contract and his numbers are mid. The committee isn’t going to sit here and claim we’ve been crunching Texans film so perhaps it’s all CJ Stroud’s fault. Puka on the other hand, is playing like the top-5 WR he is. Sweeney. stole value with that one. Rhamondre might’ve been a pick and a half. Treveyon Henderson appears to be retarded so Rhamondre is leading the backfield right now. That’s great news for Sweeney. because his RB2 is between Quinson Judkins and Tuten. Judkins missed all of camp because he’s a criminal so let’s not expect too much from him.

This team better pray for Jayden Daniels health, because without that he might as well pack it up for next year.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-draft-steal"><span class="callout-label">Sleeper:</span> Jaydon Blue
He has two healthy scratches so not a great start. But the committee trusts our scouting
department. We have a high opinion of Blue from his time at Texas and remain firm
believers that he can be a contributor for Dallas. At a minimum, he’s better than Miles
Sanders. It defies science that he’s not seeing some playing time behind Javonte Williams.</div>

    <p>I hate to do it to him, but for now the Brock Purdy injury fucks him. He’s left with one operational quarterback and it’s a 41-year-old conspiracy theorist. That stuff just isn’t gonna cut it in the big leagues. He’s now left superflexing Brenton Strange. Saquon, Kenneth and Tucker “Bob” Kraft will attempt to hold down the fort in Purdy’s absence. We’re skeptical of this team’s interest in competing for championships. Some in the league think Senior AI just wants to collect revenue sharing checks and divert them to his true passions. Chief among those passions is a league leading concession stand for fans replete with options such as potion shots, tequila lemonades, bag and chicken wings. The optimistic view is Purdy will be back next week, and Senior AI will at least be a regular bad team. If Purdy misses extended time, we could be looking at a long losing streak.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-draft-steal"><span class="callout-label">Sleeper:</span> Rachaad White
Amid all the Bucky gas, Rachaad White is quietly a nice player who can put up some stats.
With 10 carries for 65 yards and a touchdown on Monday night, he probably warrants more
involvement in the offense.</div>
