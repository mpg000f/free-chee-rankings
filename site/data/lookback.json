  "intro": "As we finish up the 4th year of the league, the committee thought it prudent to lookback and\nsummarize the first four years of the league and grade everyone\u2019s performance. We\u2019ll be\ncomparing each league owner to a US president. Given the accusations of bias from\ncertain corners of the league, we devoted some time to developing a proprietary algorithm\nto properly rank these teams. Chat \u201cChuck G\u201d GPT assisted with the math here. The\nalgorithm is like the old BCS formula in that its on a scale of 0-1 and is sure to infuriate\nsome people.\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s discuss the basics of said algorithm. Each team is assigned a\nPower Score that combines regular season performance, scoring strength, playoff resume\nand historical shame for finishing in last place.\nEach stat is normalized so the different scales are comparable and then the formula\nweights them as follows:\n\u2022 Win Percentage- 40%\no Regular season only. We\u2019re not giving double credit for playoff wins.\n\u2022 Points For- 35%\n\u2022 Point Differential- 5%\no Strong defense deserves a little boost\n\u2022 Playoff Success- 30%\no 3 points per championship\no 2 points per finals appearance\no 1 per semifinal appearance\n\u2022 Penalty for last place finishes\nAll of the above is combined into a single Power Score, which determines the rankings. The\nresults reward scholars. Please see the far right column. (Note: Zaukas and Boyle had a tie\nso there\u2019s one less game for them)",
