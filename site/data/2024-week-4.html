    <p>The committee crowns a new #1 this week. Piss might be stacked. Patrick Mahomes hasn’t even played particularly well yet and Piss is cruising to a 3-0 record. While Mahomes slumps, Dak “Black” Prescott, Breece Hall and Chris Godwin have picked up the slack. Dak was a certified monster in garbage time on Sunday, piling up nearly 30 points as he staged a comeback against the Ravens. But the main reason Piss had to pass Stewed C for the top spot in the rankings is depth. Piss has 5 receivers who are legitimate options to put in the lineup with Brian Thomas Jr, Darnell Mooney and Diontae Johnson riding pine on this all star roster. We fully expect Bfield will be receiving a telegram from Newark Street to explore trade opportunities sooner rather than later.</p>

    <p>Stewed C falls one spot this week through no fault of his own. He maintains his undefeated record and has the most points in the league. Jayden “Stormy” Daniels might be a fantasy monster this year. He took a machete to Cincinnati’s defense last night, probably ruining their chances of a playoff berth. With two 28-point outings in 3 weeks, Daniels is right up there among the elite QBs in the league for the rest of the season. And much to the chagrin of Giants fans, Saquon “Charles” Barkley continues his revenge tour after Joe Schoen offered him a contract worth 100 yen and three packs of gummy bears a week. Saquon ran for 147 yards and two tuds in handing the Saints their first loss of the season. The long-term concern for Stewed lies in the fact that he doesn’t have a reliable QB2. Minshew may get benched if Antonio “Throws Guns off Bridges” Pierce is to be believed and Drake Maye has yet to see the field.</p>

Gorlock had a tough loss to Hand me the Piss, but the fundamentals remain strong with his lineup. Joe Burrow finally got his shit together to dice up the Football Team on Monday night and Geno Smith remains one of the steadier veteran options in the league. Gorlock’s star duo of Justin Jefferson and James Cook will keep the team afloat as they wait for Kenenth Walker III to get healthy. With three straight games against teams with winning records, Gorlock needs to reassess the dual Cleveland running back strategy. Jerome “Gerald” Ford has been reasonably effective for such a bad offense, but D’onta Foreman deserves to be shot. Interestingly, he continues to roster three tight ends, and we project none of them as top 20 tight ends.</p>

We’re beginning to wonder if Trevor Lawrence is just Brock Osweiler with long hair. In any case, with 3 QB options and some nasty backs and receivers Phenom is going to make a few corpses this year. Jamarr Chase and King Henry broke out this week to lead Phenom to the highest point total in the league. He doubled up the Gotham Rogues. I couldn’t imagine being the Rogues’ front office right now.

    <p>Nobody gets how this team is 0-3. Marvin is 7th in points for but 1st in points against. Does he need to replace his defensive coordinator? People are asking. A stellar Lamar game was wasted in a close defeat against Alexander’s Unreal Team. With only one real quarterback on the roster, Marvin is in a bind when CeeDee Lamb doesn’t go off. Certain teams with excess quarterbacks are quietly putting feelers out to see if Marvin might be interested in acquiring another quarterback. Not to name names, but Andy Dalton and Gardner Minshew seem like prime candidates here. Just the committee’s opinion. No word yet on what the front office on Hudson Street thinks. This week is a must win for Marvin if he hopes to turn this around and make the playoffs. Our model gives him a 6% chance at the playoffs should he lose this week.</p>

The good news for Sweeney. is that Malik Nabers might be so nasty that he can carry Daniel “Boone” Jones to 18 points per week. Credit to Malik. The injury to Justin Herbert doesn’t affect our projections much because Sweeney. is rostering both of his backups. Interesting use of roster spots but perhaps his intel tells him Harbaugh intends to run a 2-QB system if Herbert misses time. On the flip side, D’Andre Swift is terrible.

    <p>We have our first ever tie in the rankings. Both these teams are receiving the same number of votes for the 10th spot and thus will be tied here. In some ways they’re mirror images of each other. Both with two solid QBs in the Hurts/Richardson and Allen/Goff combos, they have gaping holes elsewhere on their rosters. Deserves to be Shot is essentially starting high schoolers at receiver. Anthony Richardson is allergic to AD “Armorius Dedric” Mitchell, so he is seeing as many targets as me. Ja’Lynn Polk can’t do shit in the Pats offense. Josh Palmer is hurt like a faggot. And Xavier Legette talks like Mikey late night. This leaves Quentin Johnston as the only reliable receiver for Deserves to be Shot. For Work Ass, he has receivers aplenty but nobody at running back. Jaylen “Elizabeth” Warren is being outshone by Najee so far this year, Zeke has been running like Biden, and Trey Benson remains mostly a backup. This leaves Braelon “Tim” Allen as Work Ass’ only hope. A trade between these two former Newark Street residents could prove fruitful for both.</p>

    <p>Tua holds steady in the 12th spot. He suffered a tough defeat at the hands of Ger this week as Ger’s team got its shit together. Unfortunately, Tua’s season likely hinges on actual Tua coming back from a concussion. Many loudmouths have suggested he retire but the committee knows Tua is a true gladiator who will be back out there this season. We project a week 7 return after consulting with our in-house neurologist Charles “Dickens” Darwin. If this team can get Tua back, they have enough complementary talent to make a playoff run. Deshaun Watson is pretty bad at real football but he’s still a functional fantasy quarterback and the Josh Jacobs- Stefon Diggs duo should see enough volume to put up some points.</p>

Sam Richard Darnold looks like he’s gonna be a player all year and Ger may have fleeced the league getting him for only $24. Throwing the ball to Jefferson every play is not bad right?

In one of the more shameful showings this league has seen, the Rogues were doubled up by Phenom. Can you guess the only member of the Rogues’ lineup who scored more than 12.1 points this week? Peep the answer at the end of this section. This team flat out stinks. Stinks. CJ Stroud talks too much and has Sweeney’s hair. Javonte Williams looks like Bronny James on steroids. And somehow, he left his two highest scoring position players on the bench. I couldn’t imagine it. But we’d like to highlight one player. Zamir “Betty” White. Zamir (who the Rogues spent $10 on) has 32 carries this year. There are 34 players with at least 30 carries through 3 weeks and Zamir ranks 32nd in yards per carry out of that group. This is the Rogues RB1, and he has totaled a whopping 12.3 points through 3 weeks. Is that generally good? (Seattle defense led the Rogues with 14 points this week)</p>

Malik “Bruce” Willis dropped 25 points for Tishman in week 3 and the team still only mustered 64 points. That’s akin to the Jake Fromm Giants offense. Everyone remembers. If everyone were healthy this team might not be the worst, but they still wouldn’t be average. Tyreek “Solomon” Hill is severely hampered while Tua remains concussed, and AJ Brown has an ongoing hamstring issue. This negates the one major advantage Tishman had with elite receivers. The dual Ravens tight end strategy marches on even though Isaiah Likely and Mark “Erin” Andrews have both looked like dirt since week one. When asked for comment about how he intends to approach the next few weeks Tishman was quoted as saying “I have Bucky…”. Tishman sits with a projection of 72 points in week 4.</p>
