    <p>LW rank:1 JB sits atop the rankings again this week. He is so excited about not finally having a dogshit team that it’s been whispered at HQ that the patented three-nut showers now include a projection of his roster against the shower wall. Admittedly, these are just rumors but after what the committee saw in Manasquan, it’s not too hard to believe. Now to his team, we’ve got a potential loss this week with both Bijan and Penix Junes on bye. He’ll be subbing in Miles “Bernie” Sanders for Bijan and superflexing a Titans wide receiver. Which one is irrelevant because the Titans wouldn’t beat the Sri Lankan national team. If he’s to move to 5-0 against Scampi this week, Misters Josh and Keenan Allen will need to carry the load. A chirp: Xavier Legette should not be rostered. The man has an IQ of 68 and he has three catches for eight yards on 15 targets through four weeks.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 7 Scampi with a huge jump this week after a dominant performance. “But Mr. Chairman how can he be 2nd he only has one quarterback!” If that’s your complaint, it’s like you don’t have access to Scampi’s proprietary algorithm. Based on injury and benching probabilities, there is a 73% chance that one of Marcus Mariota, Kirk “Gibson” Cousins, or Anthony “Tony” Richardson start again this year. Scampi is playing the odds, and we expect him to win because the rest of this team is loaded. Sam Darnold is finally living up to the promise he showed all those years ago at USC. Jonathan Taylor and James Cook are unbelievable, and Davante Adams seems to have developed a nice rapport with Matthew “The Kingmaker” Stafford. Some of his horses aren’t even playing well and Scampi sits at 3-1 with the 2nd most points in the league. We expect AJ Brown and Jameson Williams to pick it up at some point. Travis Kelce probably not. A chirp: This Kelce-Andrews tight end strategy seems like a nightmare. Both these geezers suck half the time so we don’t know how Scampi is deciding whether to play the shapeshifter or stone hands each week.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 2 Sack falls one spot this week despite a heroic effort from Philadelphia’s once and future king Carson Wentz. Wentz put up 23 points in his Vikings debut even after having to fly to Dublin on short notice. After he gets a week of preparation in the North Atlantic climate, we can only imagine how dominant he’ll be. Elsewhere, Christian McCaffrey appears to be every bit the player he was at his peak. He’s opened the season with four straight games of at least 18.7 points. He’s the RB3 so far with only two touchdowns scored. Additionally, Drake London may have just had his breakout game and Wan’Dale “Jackie” Robinson is due for an uptick in targets with Malik Nabers on the shelf. Having said all that, the committee has a couple more concerns that we did last week. Is Blake Corum eating into Kyren’s workload? Are Geno Smith and Pete Carroll too retarded to feed Brock the rock? And is Bryce Young so bad as to tank Tetairoa’s stock? Kyren’s snap share is 74% so far. That’s 13% lower than last year when he had an 87% snap share for the full season. Blake Corum’s increased usage is the sole reason for the decline. It’s a concern but 74% is still a strong number. Brock’s target share is down from 26% last year to 22% this year, but the Raiders are passing the ball six less times per game so far than they did last year. For a bad team to be passing less doesn’t really add up. And lastly, yeah Bryce Young is that bad. No stats necessary. A chirp: Why is Kyler so boring? He’s fast, black and enjoys running. Generally qualities that translate to great fantasy production. And yet, Kyler is QB15 so far this year.</p>

In the short term, the absence of CeeDee Lamb seems like its going to provide a meaningful boost to George Pickens’ stock. Pickens put up the 2nd highest point total of his career with 29 points on Sunday. Haters would argue that Matt has an affinity for the big names, but the certainly are paying off so far. In addition to Pickens, Deebo is WR10 so far this year and Darren “Justin” Waller just made a triumphant debut for the Dolphins by catching two touchdowns. If these unexpected resurgences can continue, Art will be very much in the mix to unseat the league favorite Jackson Brownes.</p>
<p>The sleeper picks hitting along with his elite running back trio of Josh Jacobs, Breece Hall and Javonte Williams is formidable. Javonte is rated as the best 3rd RB in the league by our power ratings. Art will look to take down Pigs on the 7th this week. A chirp: King Jonnu has been a dud so far. He’s outside the top 20 in both targets and fantasy points for tight ends. Might be cooked.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 3 Work ass secures his first win but falls two spots. Who would’ve thought? This team is reasonably healthy with a whole lot of young horses. Bo Nix had a highly encouraging performance on Monday night. The committee still ranks him outside the top 20 real quarterbacks in the league, but as a fantasy quarterback he’s borderline top 10. I believe one committee member said, “The White Justin Fields.” Deserves credit. Having said that, this team might be carried by its Ohio State wide receiver duo. Emeka Egbuka and Jaxon Smith-Njigba are studs. The rank 7th and 8th respectively in WR fantasy points so far this year. And that’s before we even talk about Rome Odunze. Odunze is 3rd. Work Ass’ receivers are so good that Ricky Pearsall is going to be riding the bench. Now there are some concerns. Chase Brown is abysmal. He has yet to crack 50 yards yet all season. It’s more likely we’ll see him working the grill at Mashed Burgers than getting a second contract from the Bengals. And Trevor? What is there even to say. A man who was once billed as the prodigal son of quarterbacking now ranks behind Bryce Young in fantasy points. A chirp: Can George Kittle stop being such a pussy and get back on the field? With the number of stubbed toes this guy gets, you’d think he was Mickey Mouse.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 5 Stewed lost a bit of a slugfest vs Ger on Sunday. Really bad loss. The committee puts this one on poor coaching by Stewed. Sunday morning it was surprisingly announced that Jaylen Warren would be inactive. Stewed did not take this opportunity to plug Kenneth “Kenny G” Gainwell into his lineup and it cost him dearly. Kenny G went for 29 points, nearly quadrupling the combined total of Derrick “Washed” Henry and David Montgomery. Had Stewed put Kenny G in, he cruises to a victory and might be in the top three here. But now the committee is questioning his coaching decisions. Perhaps he was asleep? But should we really rank a team in the top three if their coach sleeps all day?</p>
<p>Having said that, there was good news elsewhere for Stewed. Quentin J continues his stellar start to the year, and Matthew Stafford showed he can still light it up when needed. Quentin is the WR4 through the first month of the year. A chirp: You could argue we already chirped him with the Kenny G stuff but oh man was that bad. Imagine if that loss keeps him out of the playoffs?</p>

    <p>LW rank: 7 What a two-week leap from Team Daniel huh? Written off two weeks ago at 15th in these rankings, Daniel has leapt four spots each of the past two weeks to reach 7th this week. The imminent return of Jayden Daniels plays a large factor but also does the continued balling of Daniel Jones. We’ll readily admit that Jones had his skeptics on the committee. But it’s a month into the season and Jones sits as the QB7. If he continues that while Daniels returns to dominance this team might be cooking. Dalton Kincaid might be a touchdown machine this year. And Jahmyr Gibbs is living up to his lofty preseason expectations. If Team Daniel can somehow get Shane Waldron fired and Brian Thomas Jr back on track, he could really be in the championship conversation. Whispers from some of our sources suggest Team Daniel has been heavily working the phones to try and upgrade his roster. He clearly sees the opening and is looking to seize it. We hear he’s looking to upgrade his RB2 position and is willing to shop the Gabriel-Shedeur Cleveland QB platoon. A chirp: He’s shopping Shedeur?

    <p>LW rank: 10 Here he comes. Creeping up the rankings. Earning his keep. Despite arguably the worst QB situation in the league, Sweeney. is assessing. He suffered a tough loss to JB this week, but we see reasons for optimism going forward. It start with Puka. The Flying Hawaiian is unguardable. As the clear WR1 through four weeks, I almost feel bad for the DBs trying to guard him. Puka has seven more targets, 15 more catches, and 101 more yards than the next closest receiver. This is the type of guy who can carry a team. Additionally, Quinshon Judkins is him. We would like to formally apologize for the slander from earlier in the season. Judkins has 39 carries over the past two weeks for 176 yards and two TDs. He’s clearly cemented himself as Cleveland’s RB1 and proven his ability to produce even in a bad offense. The rest of this team leaves much to be desired, but we’re betting that they can’t continue to play this bad. Let’s use Cam Ward as an example. Cam Ward ranks 34th in total points</p>
<p>among QBs. We don’t think he’s that bad. Inevitably, Brian Callahan will be fired and the Titans offense will improve. Hopefully such improvements can be seen for Nico Collins and Geno Smith as well. A chirp: I mean the Bengals offense is dead. It’s not even Tee Higgins fault but he might not be a top-40 WR for the rest of the year.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 12 An 0-4 team at 9th is a bold choice you’re thinking, right? Incorrect. Jaxson Dart is here. CMGC no longer has to play the geezer Joe Flacco. Baker and Dart immediately become one of the better QB duos in the league because of the Giants insistence on treating Dart like he’s prime Cam Newton. The battering Dart took may not be sustainable but that’s an issue for another day. Between Dart and improved performance from Stefon Diggs, things are looking up for CMGC. Achane continues to produce on a terrible team. Jeanty is breaking out. Jake Ferguson eats targets. CMGC is rounding into a rock-solid team. At 0-4, he has just a 9% chance at making the playoffs per the model, but he would be favored over all of the teams behind him in these rankings.

    <p>LW rank: 9 Tyreek no longer has a leg but we’re not sure it changes that much for Pigs, seeing as he has Waddle. Waddle should become something close to a very good player for the rest of the year. If he can’t do that, his career is cooked. If we’re going to be blunt about this ranking, it comes down to two players. Patrick Mahomes looks to be throwing it back. He’s QB3 so far, compared to his QB11 and QB8 finishes the past two years. It may not seem like a huge difference but that’s the difference between the elite crew (Josh and Lamar) vs Brocky Purdy crew. An elite Mahomes plus RJ Harvey’s breakout gives Pigs reason to be bullish going forward. H-Dubz had a pretty bad day but true believers like Pigs don’t allow bad games to shake their faith. From what we hear out of the commissioner’s office, the level of worship for H-Dubz at Bloomfield borders on cult status. LW rank: Rice Dowdle is currently his RB2. Let’s be reasonable.</p>

When you pair the absence of Burrow with the potential injury to Lamar Jackson for Obama, he falls to 11th. There’s absolutely talent on the roster, but Obama’s whole strategy revolved around fielding two elite QBs and now he’s got maybe half of one? If Lamar is healthy and pops off, this was probably an overreaction, and the committee will happily eat chirps in the town square. It’s really too bad because Obama nailed some of these picks. Xavier Worthy looks electric. Tyler Warren might be the best tight end in the league right now. And Jakobi Meyers has been surprisingly functional.</p>

Justin Jefferson looked like his vintage self with the legendary Carson Wentz under center. Omarion Hampton rumbles down the field like Chris Christie seeing a breakfast buffet. And Marvin Harrison Jr may have saved his career with a nice performance on Thursday Night Football. Derrick’s quarterbacks still stink, but he has real players across his lineup and even some solid bench depth with Michael Pittman Jr and Chris Godwin. Most teams in the league can’t say that.

<p>Drake Maye is unbelievable. I think everyone knows it at this point. I shudder to think what he’s about to do to Buffalo’s atrocious defense this week. It might be one of those 450 yards and 5 touchdowns type of games. Dak Prescott also had a monster game this week. The Dak-Drake plan of two very good QBs is working for SDZ. The trouble is just about nothing else is working. Ja’Marr Chase is dead. He’s frowning at the moon on the bench while they get blown off the field. Converting 8 targets into 23 yards is JV football stuff. Tony Pollard is getting 18.5 touches a game and doing nothing with it because the Titans offense is so bad. And worst of all might be Zach Charbonnet. We don’t care what his stats say. Watching that guy try to run the football is worse than listing to Opera Hour at afters.

Between these horses, Jared “from Subway” Goff and Travis ETN, Ger is fielding a reasonably competitive team. That is a lot more than can be said for Senior AI Coke. The trouble is Nabers.
