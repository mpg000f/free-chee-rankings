    <p>LW rank: 2 CMGC! CMGC! CMGC! The committee once again proves why it’s the best in the business with its strong belief in CMGC so far this year. We had ranked CMGC higher than his points or wins totals would suggest was warranted earlier this year and it was due to our strong belief in this upside he had. And boy is he showing that upside these past couple weeks. He thrashed Ginny Sack to end Sack’s 4-game winning streak. He’s put over 180 points these past two weeks which is the most in the league. Looking at this lineup, he’s now got upside, depth and some absolute dawgs. Jaxson Dart has been a revelation averaging 22.6 points over his four starts which is 4th in QB points per game this year behind only the big three of Patrick, Lamar and Josh. Is that generally good company to be keeping? When you add Dart to Baker’s MVP campaign, Jake “The Snake” Fergusion’s TE1 activities in Dallas, and some solid play from the rest of this lineup we’re looking at a serious championship contender. Now, CMGC put himself behind the eight ball by starting 1-4, but if he’s able to go 5-2 from here on out he’ll lock up a playoff berth and be very dangerous come December. Midseason Draft checkin: Ashton Jeanty ($44) has been a disappointment as the RB17. Most thought he’d tear up the league as a rookie similar to Zeke or Saquon. But De’Von Achane ($36) has more than offset that as a mindless warthog chugging along as the RB5 for the Miami offense. Baker ($50), Dart ($11) and Flacco ($6) are felony thefts especially after that Flacco to Cincinnati trade. The committee seriously underrated Flacco’s upside in a new environment. Diggs ($7), Olave ($6) and Kyle Pitts ($2) have all been good players for their price. Biggest chirp here is Ladd McConkey ($29) as his target share has significantly declined vs last year.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 3 Not sure this week could’ve gone better for Professor Scampi even if we scripted it. It all starts with Jonathan “Tishman” Taylor for Scampi. Taylor is the 2nd highest scoring player in fantasy behind only Patrick Mahomes so far this year at 24 points per game. Taylor now has 11 touchdowns so far this year and is on pace to clear 25 tuds this year. The committee isn’t really an “on pace” type of crew because it reminds us of Aaron Judge graphics from May, but we thought it was worth mentioning. After Taylor, AJ Brown finally translated all those targets he’s been seeing into a breakout game with 26 points while Davante Adams</p>
<p>took advantage of Puka’s absence to catch three touchdowns in London. Scampi slapped up 150 points without even breaking a sweat. He almost felt bad with how thoroughly he dismantled Team Daniel right when Team Daniel was finally building some confidence. Perhaps the most impressive part was Scampi doing all this with James Cook on bye. We haven’t even gotten to the best part for Scampi yet. Jayden “Stormy” Daniels went down with another injury on Sunday. Marcus Mariota is one of the most valuable backups in the league. Credit to Scampi for knowing that and keeping him on the roster. What an absolute masterclass in coaching this week. Scampi moves into 1st place. Midseason Draft checkin: Sam Darnold ($29) as his only real QB was great value. Jonathan Taylor ($34) and James Cook ($30) is ridiculous. Davante Adams ($15) and Jaylen Warren ($8) will certainly do the trick as well. Warren is the RB16 in points per game so far. While AJ Brown ($33) has underwhelmed, this was an elite draft by Scampi. The main criticism the committee can offer is that his blind hatred of the Cowboys (4-12) allowed him to get rid of Jake Ferguson after drafting him for $2.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 5 Work Ass is in a very similar situation to CMGC. His team is just slightly worse. Both have underperformed the raw talent on their rosters and put themselves in a challenging position to make a playoff run, but both have the talent and the coaching to make it happen. While it’s unlikely Bo Nix will ever drop 40 again, it’s good to see that the beardless prophet has it in him. This team has been and will continue to be carried by its elite wide receivers. Jaxon Smith-Njigba continues to show why Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave called him the best guy on the team when they were all at Ohio State. Rome Odunze had a poor week, but he is still a bright spot for Homo Dubz offense in Chicago. Emeka Egbuka and Ricky Pearsall are hurt, but they’ll get healthy and keep humming for Work Ass. Work Ass was so confident in his team yesterday, we have it on good authority he was decimating bag for the first time in several months. One well placed source tells the committee Work Ass slammed Mikey against the wall and bellowed “BAG?!” in his face in the middle of Swigs yesterday. Suffice it to say Mrs. Work Ass was not pleased upon his arrival back at Grand Street. Nonetheless, he deserves credit for an outstanding performance. Midseason Draft checkin: Chase Brown ($33) has been a slob, but things are looking up with the Flacco addition. Trevor Lawrence ($33) and Bo Nix ($46) have been adequate. Work Ass made his bones on the cheaaapppp picks. JSN ($19) and Emeka Egbuka ($10) are both top-5 receivers while Odunze is top ten. And Skattebo ($5) is proving to be one of the steals of the season. Great work finding undervalued assets.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 1 It was a tough week for Art despite the win over Gorlock. We’ll get to Gorlock later, but let’s just say the committee doesn’t put a whole lot of stock in beating that outfit. We have to give Art credit for keeping a steady head and stacking wins knowing the regular season is nothing but prep for the playoff run. At 6-1, Art is all but assured of a playoff berth. Our model gives him a 98% chance of making the playoffs and 73% chance of a top two seed. The main reason he falls three spots this week is some shaky performances from key members of his team. We should start with Tua. Tua scored 0.6 points. You might be thinking that’s the worst performance of all time. You would be mistaken. There have been quite a few negative fantasy point performances over the years and the worst one this century was by a good friend of the committee, Nathan Peterman. Please see below for Mr. Peterman’s immortal stat line.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the point at hand though. Tua was terrible. Cleveland’s defense had him in a straitjacket all game. The committee can only imagine the reaction from Hurts HQ (Jefferson) watching this game. We assume his patented evil laugh was heard echoing down the block at least once or twice. The reason we’re harping on Tua is Art’s depth advantage seems to be disappearing. Tua was benched for Quinn Ewers in this game and with JJ McCarthy still on the shelf, Art could potentially be looking at only one starting QB. Now, the committee thoroughly scouted Ewers at Texas and we think he’s a zookeeper at best so we don’t anticipate him starting much. However, we would be remiss not to acknowledge the possibility. Additionally, we’re concerned about Deebo Samuel’s injury and the complete ineffectiveness of Jerry Jeudy since Dillon “BG” Gabriel took over the Browns QB position. Midseason Draft checkin: Mostly good here. Josh Jacobs ($38) is RB4 in points per game and has been a bargain. Justin Herbert ($29) was stealing relative to some of the other</p>
<p>starting QB prices. Geno Smith ($37) and CJ Stroud ($40) come to mind. Herbert is a top-10 QB while both Smith and Stroud sit outside the top-20. Credit Art. George Pickens ($12), Javonte Williams ($4) and Deebo Samuel ($4) have all been true difference makers for cheap. The main challenge for Art is Tua ($38) and JJ McCarthy ($29) are two of his three QBs and neither seem locked in for the second half of the year.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 7 The committee is forced to give credit to JB after quite the win this week. Josh Allen was on bye and Bucky Irving remains on the shelf with injury and he still found a way to thoroughly spank Team Obama Sopranos. It was a close call between JB and Ginny Sack for 5th, but we leaned JB mostly due to his superior QB play. He’s done a good enough job finding serviceable WR/RB types to close the gap with Ginny’s elite corps. As we’ve mentioned before, this team’s success will hinge on just how dominant Josh Allen and Bijan “Jackie” Robinson can be, but some of the sleeper picks by JB continue to deliver. Keenan Allen is 4th in the entire league in targets through seven weeks. Juwan Johnson is 4th among tight ends in targets through seven weeks. Finding these two reliable options for the price of a peanut butter sandwich and a moldy Coors Light is why JB is a contender and not working the phones selling his team off like he’s done in years past. Additionally, he’s done an adequate job finding options to fill out the lineup in a pinch. Kayshon Boutte, Bam Knight, Elic Ayomanor. Nobody will sing songs about any of them, but they can provide production when needed. The committee’s main concern with JB is coaching style. He seems to model his strategy after Aaron Glenn with a very rah rah, hype the boys up mentality. We’ve seen this fall flat a couple of times already this year. What will happen if Allen and Bijan decide to tune him out because they think he’s a two-faced politician like Bill Clinton? Something to monitor. Midseason Draft checkin: After crying like Mickey Mouse about getting Josh Allen ($70), he’s performed as expected as the QB2 in points per game. Bijan Robinson ($56) similarly is performing up to his price. Bucky Irving’s ($36) injury and Michael Penix’s ($28) smelly du rag have kept this team from operating at its peak potential. Keenan Allen ($2) is potentially the best steal in the whole league while Khalil Shakir ($3) and Elic Ayomanor ($1) were other solid cheap plays. The rest of his picks were complete busts but working the wire has done wonders to keep his team afloat.</p>

<p>Mr. Sack ran into some trouble this week as the Cookie Monster Golf Cart absolutely steamrolled him. It’s really too bad for Sack because he wasted a mammoth performance from Christian McCaffrey. McCaffrey now has the 3rd most points of any player in the league through half the fantasy season, trailing only Patrick Mahomes and Jonathan Taylor. He continues to be one of the best bets in fantasy. Not a bad guy to anchor your team around, right? Having said that, our level of concern elsewhere for this team has risen. Kyren Williams saw his lowest snap % of the season this week at 60% as Blake “Griffin” Corum continues to carve out a role in that backfield. This played a big part in Kyren’s lowest point total of the season. Additionally, we’re concerned about the volatility level of players like Drake London and Tetairoa McMillan. Obviously, it’s early in T-Mac’s career so we won’t kill him, but let’s take a deep dive on Drake London. London has played six games this year. Four of them ended in single digits while two exceeded twenty. For a guy who was billed as the WR9 in consensus preseason rankings, this level of inconsistency is concerning. On the flip side, he’s 6th in the league in targets so maybe Michael Penix is just off-target too much. Our next concern is the health of Brock Bowers and Kyler Murray. Both are expected back soon. Bowers in particular worries the committee because he was expected to be the clear best tight end in the league and this injury plus Geno Smith being a retard have limited his ceiling. Mr. Sack might be more of a 2nd round exit type team than a true championship contender. Midseason Draft checkin: Christian McCaffrey ($44), Kyler Murray ($32), Romeo Doubs ($2), Wan’Dale Robinson ($1) have all been unequivocal wins. Robinson is a true WR2 so far this year and he cost $1. That’s better value than the two for one Mashed Burgers deal. Romeo Doubs as the WR28 has also significantly outperformed his draft value. Conversely, Bowers ($26) and Drake London ($34) need to show more to live up to their lofty price tags.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 9 Is this team perfectly mid? Some people are asking. He’s 7th in points for which is highly average but has ridden an elite defense (2nd fewest points against) to a 5-2 record to put himself in position to make the playoffs and defend his title. Even renowned haters like Monroe Street had effusive praise for the defensive scheme SDZ has been running. One member of Sweeney.’s front office said, “That’s got to be the most confusing alignment we’ve ever seen. Geno and Cam would have no chance to put up points against him.” Credit him for crediting SDZ.</p>
<p>SDZ’s formula isn’t quite as dynamic as last year’s when he had some elite star power and solid depth, but the Maye-Dak-Chase trio is getting to be among the best in the league. Please see the chart below for reference.</p>
<p>As you can see, the Maye-Dak-Chase trio is the highest scoring trio of any in the league. Albeit this doesn’t account for bye weeks and such yet so it might be a bit skewed. Nonetheless it shows just how heavily SDZ leans on his big three. And none of them have had their bye weeks yet. At 5-2, he’s got an 83% chance to make the playoffs, but we aren’t confident he has the type of team to truly make a run. That mostly comes down to the rest of the roster. Matthew Golden was supposed to be the Packers new WR1. He has one game in double digits the entire year. Tony Pollard has seen a ton of volume and done nothing with it as he’s averaging 9.5 points per game and is the RB26 overall. This team is a pretender unless somebody unexpectedly breaks out. For fun, let’s look at the other top trios in the league by name. See the table below.</p>
<p>Would hate to be at the bottom of this list, right? Midseason Draft checkin: After a slow start, Jamarr Chase ($55) is up to WR3 and looks likely to at least meet his price tag. Drake Maye ($45) and Dak Prescott ($56) are the QB4 and QB2 respectively so far. Absolutely meeting expectations, but we already knew that. The trouble is most of the other guys he spent cash on are complete ogres. Tony Pollard ($14) is a bust. Zach Charbonnet ($6) isn’t much better. JK Dobbins ($7) has been decent. Evan Engram ($3) should be on Mikey’s team. And then the rest of his picks are criminals.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 8 Great consistency out of this squad. He beat Derrick in a hotly contested matchup that was decided when CJ Stroud couldn’t do enough against Seattle Monday night. Patrick Mahomes continues to look like the vintage version of himself while Pigs gets timely contributions elsewhere. The Patriots defense was just such a veteran play by a seasoned coach which helped offset Homo Dubz worst game of the season. HD had just 172 yards and a pick against the Saints. Jordan Addison and Rico Dowdle look like they’ll be able to maintain their hot starts and be real pieces for this roster. Addison has three straight games in double figures since his return from DUI Enthusiast camp and Dowdle still got 17 carries even with Chuba Hubbard’s return to the lineup. Even still, the committee views this team as very much in the same boat as SDZ. He’s got a couple of elite players, but probably not enough to be a real title threat. The goal here should be to make the playoffs and celebrate like Grubbs is having all you can eat wings for $10.99. Midseason Draft checkin: Mahomes ($51) is the best value of any QB this year. Waddle ($10), Addison ($3) and Dowdle ($1) are likely to outperform their values significantly, but injuries likely cooked this team. Tyreek ($26) and James Conner ($22) are both out for the</p>
<p>year while Terry McLaurin ($17) has missed time already. Without that sort of draft capital in the lineup, it would be a struggle for anyone to field an elite team.</p>

David Montgomery ran like Walter Hudson with bricks strapped to his feet on Monday night and Stewed was still able to hold off Sweeney. as Nico Collins put up a dud. This was a massive win if he’s to have any hope of climbing back into the playoff picture. He’s now just 2-5 but with the 5th most points in the league, we have to acknowledge he’s got some potential. Jalen Hurts and Matthew Stafford both balled out on Sunday to combined for 51 points while Devonta Smith and Kyle Monangai did what they do best. Stewed still only has a 29% chance to make the playoffs because he’s got 11 teams ahead of him in the standings and all his best players still have byes coming up. With three Eagles starting, the committee can almost pencil in a loss for week 9 when they’re on bye. With the 2nd most points allowed of anyone in the league, Stewed C ought to put a bigger emphasis on defensive intensity in the 2nd half of the season if he’s to pull off this improbable comeback. Midseason Draft checkin: Derrick Henry ($45) has been middling since a hot start, Jalen Hurts ($68) has delivered as expected, and Matthew Stafford ($24) has been a huge steal so far. Even Garrett Wilson ($17) was outperforming his sticker price before injury. David Montgomery ($18) has been a Trent Richardson level bust as Jahmyr Gibbs has taken over that backfield while none of Stewed’s cheap dart throws worked. Tough breaks.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 10 Obama took the loss this week but doesn’t budge mostly because there’s no justification for moving him down with how disturbing some of the teams at the bottom of the rankings are. Given the injury adversity this team has faced, the committee is choosing to take an optimistic view of them. Lamar Jackson is expected back soon after his hamstring injury which will catapult Obama right back into the thick of things. That will move Dillon Gabriel into his QB2 spot which makes this look like much more of a functional football team. At 5- 2, he probably needs three more wins to clinch a playoff berth. Getting Lamar back with Travis Hunter breaking out, Tyler Warren continuing to look like one of the best tight ends in the league and Kimani Vidal partaking in activities could make the playoffs a reality. Our model gives him about a 50-50 shot with a 49.7% chance to make the playoffs. However, this team definitely has its detractors. One pessimist called out in our midseason power poll that, “this team blows cock. He’s only 5-2 because he has the 2nd fewest points</p>
<p>against.” That is definitely something to consider as he’s got fewer points scored than points against but given the hope of Lamar and Burrow returning we can’t write this team off just yet. Midseason Draft checkin: Lamar ($66) and Burrow ($59) have been disasters so far due to injury. Chuba Hubbard ($16) was providing value before Rico Dowdle may have stolen his job. Cooper Kupp ($8) is old. And Jakobi Meyers ($7) plays for the worst team in the league (maybe).

This is his 3rd injury since entering the league last year, so the committee is pretty close to applying the dreaded “injury-prone” label to him. Once you get that label slapped on you, it’s pretty hard to shake it off. It’s a shame because with the way Daniel Jones and Jahmyr Gibbs are playing, this team could be dangerous. If you refer to the triplets table up above, you’ll see the Jones-Gibbs-Daniels trio is 5th best in the league despite Daniels missing two games already. Without Daniels, this team is stretched too thin. Dalton Kincaid has been good, and Hollywood Brown is a nice surprise. Otherwise, we’ve got disappointments like Brian Thomas Jr and DJ Moore. Management here deserves some props for turning Dillon Gabriel into Zay Flowers. Flowers will be a serviceable starter when Lamar gets back in the lineup.

    <p>LW rank: 14 No more sleeping for him. Sweeney. moves up two spots following a shootout duel for Stewed C. He took the loss, but it gave the committee some real reason to believe going forward. Quinshon Judkins is clearly a beast. He’s seen 20+ touches in four of his last five games and has hit at least 13+ points in all four of those. Criminal or no, he’ll be a force in</p>
<p>this league going forward. Additionally, Rhamondre Stevenson shook off his fumbling issues to have a season-high 88 rushing yards against the Titans. That running back duo plus Trey McBride and Tee Higgins reemergence are putting this team much closer to the mid-tier than the Bleached Tuck tier. Most impressively, he put up this performance with Puka out injured. Now, there’s still some concern given the QB situation. Geno Smith should just be put on a boat and sent out to sea. Any hope of a comeback is lost for him. On the other hand, Cam Ward looked legit on Sunday. The committee is always dialed in on Drake Maye film, so we got a pretty close look at Ward and liked what we saw. It didn’t necessarily translate to a huge fantasy day, but with Callahan no longer coaching Ward will definitely improve over the 2nd half of the year. Midseason Draft checkin: Trey McBride ($24) is good, Puka Nacua ($34) is a king, and Bhayshal Tuten ($2) is the team mascot. Nico Collins ($37) and Geno Smith ($37) are both underwhelming to say the least. Tee Higgins ($21) has been okay given the Burrow injury situation and we’re hopeful for the 2nd half with him. Judkins ($1) is just why you play the game.</p>

It’s just a whole lot of not great with these two. I was sitting here for five minutes trying to do some positive spin zone but it’s hard to see. For example, the committee was pretty excited about the return of Rashee Rice for Ger. Rice returns and puts up 19.7 points. Ger still only scores 80 points. That’s just the hallmark of a bad team. Derrick is somewhat better but with Hampton on IR and Justin Jefferson not lighting it up as he has in the past, we don’t see the spark for him either. Having said that, we’re going to use this section to focus on one coward from each team. Marvin Harrison Jr. and TreVeyon Henderson. Former teammates at Ohio State, they both have severely underwhelmed so far. Harrison was billed as a generational prospect who would follow in the footsteps of his father as the next great NFL wide receiver. He was drafted over Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr and Ladd McConkey. And here he is in his sophomore season averaging 7.4 points per game. That’s barely good enough to be top 30 in total points so far. What an absolute fraud. He should be forced to issue a formal apology to Ohio State as he’s single-handedly ruining their sterling reputation for elite wide receiver</p>
<p>play. While JSN, Olave, Garrett Wilson and Emeka Egbuka light up the league, Harrison routinely looks like me in boots. Henderson might somehow be worse. Henderson was billed as a lightning quick playmaker with gamebreaking upside. Some bold people even compared him to Jahmyr Gibbs. Instead, he was the third string RB on his own team when Antonio Gibson was healthy and he’s so bad that he can’t beat out Rhamondre Stevenson (The Fumbling Enthusiast). There are even some who think it’s his lack of intellect that’s holding him back as he doesn’t know the playbook. We were able to reach one anonymous source from Ohio State who said, “yeah his junior year he had to a book report for class, and he chose One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish because he didn’t know how to read any other books.” What a disaster for Ger and the Pats. Midseason Draft Checkin: Justin Jefferson ($47), Marvin Harrison Jr. ($17), CJ Stroud ($40), Alvin Kamara ($20), Bryce Young ($22) have probably all underwhelmed their price. However, Courtland Sutton ($6) and Michael Pittman ($2) have been studs. Omarion Hampton ($24) was also a truck pre- injury. We can’t even look at Ger’s draft. Russell Wilson ($15) is like buying Beyond Meat stock at the height of the Great Vegan Conversion in 2021. We couldn’t even imagine it. Obviously, we cooked TreVeyon Henderson ($22) above. Nabers ($45) injury was a killer.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 15 For the 2nd straight week, we start this section with Justin Fields. He continues to show why he’s one of Bloomfield’s favorite players. After having -10 net passing yards last week against Denver, Fields improved to have 25 net passing yards this week. Credit to him. Still, Fields has 15 net passing yards over two weeks. Those are numbers comparable to Stephen Hawking. The only bright spots for Gorlock continue to be Amon-Ra and CeeDee. Both scored 17+ in wins for their respective teams. We would recommend Gorlock work the trade market to see what he could get back for either of them, but at this point it is probably too late. He has the 2nd fewest points in the league, ahead of only the winless Coke Master. Midseason Draft checkin: CeeDee Lamb ($48) and Amon-Ra ($42) were pricey but worth it, even when you consider CeeDee’s injury. Jordan Love ($46) hasn’t exactly torn it up but he’s QB16 in points per</p>
<p>game. He’s been fine. Fields ($29) is a comedy of errors while Isiah Pacheco ($17) looks like nothing more than a small cog in the Chiefs machine. Hunter Henry ($2) was kind of free.</p>

    <p>LW rank: 16 Our favorite part of the week. He was very close to setting his lineup this week but didn’t quite get there. Let’s drop some credits in the chat for him anyway. Aaron Rodgers is somehow the best player on this team which is wild to say in the year 2025. Tucker Kraft is playing nicely as well. Beyond that, Saquon stinks, Kenneth Walker stinks, Mike Evans can’t stay healthy and McSwiggans HQ smells worse and worse every day. Let’s just get to the player assessment. Player Assessment Aaron Rodgers Prison but good Mike Evans Hurt Rashod Bateman Zoo Saquon Barkley Zoo Kenneth Walker Zoo Tucker Kraft Good Rachaad White Not Bad Colston Loveland Soon Brenton Strange Hurt but also Zaukas Adam Thielen Prison Brocky Purdy Hurt Jayden Higgins Zoo Mason Rudolph Boyle Dalton Schultz Prison</p>
<p>Midseason Draft checkin: Saquon ($59) is really bad. I’d rather pay the cover at Sonny Bongos. Rodgers ($30) is actually pretty good for the QB15. Brock Purdy’s ($47) toe is killing him. Kenneth Walker ($28) is in a platoon with Charbonnet. Mike Evans ($21) is done. Tucker Kraft ($4) and Rachaad White ($2) were great value. Just an atrocity of a team overall. Worst team since the advent of the league.</p>
