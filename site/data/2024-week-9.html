    <p>Derrick just keeps on humming. He’s like Genghis Khan in the early 1200s laying waste to everything in his path. He again dropped 150 points this week, meaning he has not scored less than 135 points since week two. In week two, we still thought the Jets were a real football team. Imagine that. Bo Nix and Trevor Lawrence decided to play like superstars combining for 7 total touchdowns. It’s almost not even fair at this point. This team is so stacked he left Jaylen Waddle on the bench even with Tua’s return. Derrick Henry and Ja’Marr Chase both had fairly mediocre weeks and it didn’t matter at all. The committee heard rumors Harrison “Get Back in the Kitchen” Butker even held a Monday night powwow with unlimited strippers to celebrate Derrick getting to 7-1. Cause for concern: Is he peaking too soon? On paper, we’ve got no gripes about this squad, but can he keep this up until January? Everyone remembers the ’07 Pats. The committee will be monitoring closely.</p>

    <p>Pigs was legitimately fuming when he saw the committee ranked him 11th two weeks ago. Sources have been able to confirm that he slept in the zombie room on the floor for several nights as “motivation”. It seems to be working as Pigs has been playing great ball since then. He played a close game against Cap Stoppers in which Monday night heroics by Cement Boots and TJ Watt led to a 2-point victory. Suffice it to say the committee is very impressed with this turnaround. Homo Williams still stinks but otherwise things are looking way up. Stafford got his receivers back and immediately threw for 4 touchdowns. We might’ve been a bit harsh on him last week. Kyle “Busch” Pitts waited 3 years but finally decided to play like the elite prospect he was billed as and Jixon continues to be the focal point of the Texans’ attack. Some would go as far as to say he’s carrying CJ Stroud on his back. Cause for concern: Not that he was doing much in Cleveland, but we’d like to see Amari Cooper get some more targets from Josh Allen. Maybe it’s just taking a couple weeks to build some chemistry.</p>

    <p>The Stoppers have moved from 9th to 3rd in just two weeks after a couple of outstanding performances. First, he pancaked Sweeney. by nearly 100 points and then followed that up by falling just shy against Pigs this week. Full disclosure, the committee was fully prepared to put Cap Stoppers 2nd until Pigs completed that epic comeback. We have him at 83.4% to make the playoffs now. Even more impressively, he has done this while fighting the injury bug. This week some of the gentlemen who missed games included Travis “Scott” Etienne, DK Metcalf, Dallas “Braden” Goedert and TJ Hockenson. Is he kidding with all these tight ends? When healthy, he’s rostering 3 of our top 8 tight ends for the rest of the season. We have it on good authority several GMs have contacted the Cap Stoppers front office to gauge the appetite for a trade. The tight end landscape is dismal around the league. Cause for concern: Rodgers. Like is that guy serious? He might have been better off running for VP than looking like a washed-up Blaine Gabbert this year. Luckily for the Cap Stoppers, Baker has been playing true QB1 football.</p>

    <p>Even after the brutal loss to AI Coke, we couldn’t drop him too far. Drake Maye left the game early with a concussion and that was brutal for Stewed because he was on a tear and looked poised to drop 30. Otherwise, it was a slow day for Saquon as Jalen “Vulture” Hurts “ran” in 3 touchdowns. Jayden Daniels continues to amaze however, adding a late flurry of points with that Hail Mary at the end of the game. Stewed may no longer be the runaway favorite, but the committee still views him in the inner circle of contenders. Cause for concern: WR injuries are not great. Mike Evans having a pulled hamstring while Jameson Williams decided to take too many anabolic steroids is exactly what Stewed didn’t need. Let’s hope he gets these guys back for the playoffs.</p>

    <p>Gorlock lost a close one to HWYT this week after Jameis Winston “Churchill” came out of nowhere to shred the Ravens defense. HWYT is climbing back from the brink. Outside of James Cook, nobody showed up for Gorlock this week. Burrow and Geno were mid. Jefferson was fine. Addison and Rashod Bateman played like dirt smoothies. The committee fully expects a bounce back next week against Ger but this was a tough showing. He remains with an 86% chance to make the playoffs. Cause for concern: Depth. When Gorlock’s stars are humming it doesn’t matter, but on a week like this one it would really pay to have a better flex option than Rashod Bateman. That scumbag is allergic to catching Lamar’s dimes.</p>

    <p>Piss won a close one against Sansa and thus remains ranked above him here. While Breece Hall and Jordan “George” Mason didn’t do much, Mahomes had his best game of the season (19.18 points) and Cedric “Diggory” Tillman dropped 25. Arguably the best game of</p>
<p>Cedric’s life. Piss has even built out his QB depth nicely with Mason Rudolph on the bench. He’s on solid footing for the playoffs after this win with an 83% chance of making it. For the remainder of these teams, it is getting dicey. Cause for concern: Can Kareem Hunt keep up this pace if Isiah Pacheco returns? It seems unlikely.

    <p>Sansa has fallen from 3rd to 7th over the past two weeks but we still like his team quite a bit. Him and Piss had a clash of titans this week that some media members compared to the Thrilla in Manila. The continued absence of Derek Carr couple with Tee “Made of Paper” Higgins getting ruled out may have done Sansa in. Even still, he might have the best running backs in the league between Kyren, B-Rob and Jonathan Taylor and Kyler continues to ball. With his 4-4 record, we still like him to make the playoffs in over 70% of simulations. Sansa again stuck with Jets defense and it bit him in the ass. The Jacoby Brissett-Rhamondre Stevenson duo dominated the Jets enough that their defense only mustered two points. Bob Saleh was sitting on his couch slugging a two liter of Dr. Pepper Cherry cackling at the tv. Cause for concern: We touched on it earlier but the depth that Sansa had early in the year is gone as the injuries pile up. Rashee Rice dead. Derek Carr hurt. Higgins hurt. Christian Kirk has no collarbone. How much more can this roster sustain?</p>

    <p>Mediocre? Maybe. Waiting to harness his potential at the right time? Probably not. Shot has scored 879 points this year. He has given up 885 for a -6 point differential. The next closest differentials are Sansa at +31 and Marvin at -35. The point is this team might just be textbook average. He’ll probably go 7-7 and either sneak into the playoffs and lose immediately or he’ll finish 9th and win in first round of the pig-off. Boring, forgettable piece of shit faggot ass team. CeeDee Lamb put the nail in the coffin for Shot on Sunday night with a bombastic 4th quarter. Newark Street is considering trade options, but he might just try to rip someone off. Cause for concern: Brian Thomas Jr. BTJ has been a revelation for this team as he has legitimately terrible receivers otherwise. And now BTJ is “questionable” with a “chest” injury. Sounds like another “chest bruise” the committee is familiar with.</p>

    <p>Sweeney. is also pretty stagnant in these rankings recently. He had a huge opportunity to get a win this week and was robbed on Monday night. Robbed not by the Democrats, or the refs or Willow Street, but by Daniel Jones. Heading into Monday night, Sweeney. essentially needed Daniel Jones just to outscore Jaylen Warren by 2 points and he would secure victory. Even deep into the 4th quarter it looked like Sweeney. would win. But then Jones fumbled and threw a pick on the last two drives to blow the game like the retarded dickhead that he is. 6 years of this buffoonery New Yorkers have had to suffer through. I’d rather watch Jake Fromm run sneaks for the rest of the season. Cause for concern: Nico Collins’ health. The good news is that he’s “on track” to return in week 10 against Detroit. This would be massive for Sweeney. and could potentially catapult him back up near the top 4 in the rankings. Collins has been a professional decimator this season.</p>

    <p>That stupid tie is all that’s keeping Marvin from being in the above tier. Right after we ripped his chances of making the playoffs, he comes out and dominates Deserves to be Shot. The lineup has some elite players but when your superflex is Michael “Dexter” Pittman Jr, we have a hard time seeing a playoff run in the offing. The good news for Marvin is that he has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that he has nothing to fear from the loser’s bracket. He could put back 12 lbs of cheeseballs, 15 cheesesteaks or even the $50 Taco Bell challenge without even breaking a sweat. Cause for concern: Is LaPorta back? Or was this a one-week blip. The metrics do show his performance improves markedly as long as Jameson Williams is not in the lineup.</p>

    <p>We didn’t want to give it to him. We despise this team. Bunch of low upside jackwagons squeaking out low scoring wins somehow. I suppose Kirk Cousins has been really good. His 28-point outburst against helped Gotham to roll Ger. And with Puka back, he might have a legitimate WR1 going forward. Puka’s hair is among the best in the league. It has been compared to Boyle’s hair in April 2020 for its thickness. Ladd McConkey had a breakout game but based on his average depth of target, most scholars on the committee consider this to be a fluke. Also, picking up Isaac “Newton” Guerendo is a pretty nice addition. Team still stinks though. Cause for concern: Did he drop Zamir White too early? Was a second half breakout coming?</p>

    <p>Tishman has somehow weathered the storm and sits just one game out of playoff position. For a team that looked like the 2017 Browns a month ago, this is beyond impressive. There have even been whispers that the Coach of the Year trophy will be headed to Monroe Street at the end of season. The committee finds such talk premature, but we are beginning to take Tishman seriously as a threat. The Jim Winston acquisition is potentially season saving. A healthy Jordan Love, Tyreek and AJ Brown has Tishman feeling good about himself. When reached for quote after his win this week, a spokesperson for the team said “That’s just what the Tishman does.” Tishman currently has an 18% chance of touching playoffs. Cause for concern: Can Tyreek pace? We still think so but in Tua’s return he only had 10 points. For Tishman to make an unlikely playoff run, he’ll need more from Tyreek.</p>

    <p>After a huge week last week, Tua got crushed in the injury department this week and on the field. Derrick (the steamroller) dropped 153 on him. Tough but it’s been happening to everyone for the past month so we could’ve shaken that one off. The trouble is Stefon “WR1” Diggs suffered a knee injury and will miss the rest of the year.  Furthermore, Josh Jacobs, Tank Bigsby, and Calvin Ridley are all potential game time decisions this week. It looks dire, but given his 3-5 record and the rise of Keon Coleman and Russell Wilson, we can’t totally rule Tua out yet. The algorithm currently gives him a 12% chance at making the playoffs. Cause for concern: Did Bryce Young look too good? Maybe it was just coaching by Ger that made Bryce look bad because in his first game on Tua’s roster he slapped up a clean 15.56 points. That’s the most he’s had all year. If Bryce keeps this up, there will be a QB controversy on this team.</p>

Worse, if Mason Rudolph continues to play over Will Levis, Ger will be stuck playing guys like Tyler Boyd or Hunter Henry in the flex. Can you imagine if Ger has to do eating challenge?

Black Deez might be benched but we’re not sure it matters much because Joe “Elite” Flacco will step in and average 22 a game. The biggest issue here is running backs. Jaylen Warren and Braelon Allen wouldn’t cut it for Riverdell high school let alone a competitive fantasy team in Free Chee.

Even after the huge win, AI Coke is 2-6 and has a 1% chance of making playoffs. Credit where credit is due though. The Cade Otton superflex play will go down as one of the most Nostradamus picks of all time. Otton saw 10 targets for the second consecutive week and caught 9 passes for 81 yards and 2 touchdowns. Otton led the charge in handing Stewed his 3rd loss of the season. Cause for concern: Several, but let’s stick with the fact that Brock Purdy is the only real quarterback on the roster.
