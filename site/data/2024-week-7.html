    <p>As both Stewed C and Sansa struggled this week, Derrick continues his hot streak by defeating Deserves to be Shot (who put up the 3rd highest point total of the week). This team is ludicrous. The committee isn’t sure if any of his 3 quarterbacks are good at real football, but it doesn’t really matter because they all dropped 18+ points this week. Some teams (Ger) would kill for that kind of production from the most important position in the league. Derrick Henry continues to defy time in a way not seen since Chancellor Palpatine diced up the tentacle headed jedi. Derrick has scored at least 136 points every week since week 3. If he keeps up this pace, we will be talking about one of the greatest teams of all time. Newark Street Stat: Derrick “Future HOF” Henry has 8 touchdowns in the first 6 games of the season. This is the 2nd most in any six-game stretch of his career behind only the first 6 games of 2021 where the human freight train had 10 touchdowns before missing the second half of the season due to injury.</p>

    <p>Stewed is easily fuming reading this but it’s mostly positive news for him. Saquon Barkley played like Gallo late night and Stewed still pulled out the win with a great performance by Garrett Wilson on Monday night. The consensus on the committee was that the emergence of Drake Maye and potentially Tyler “Blanchard” Allgeier gives this team an upside we didn’t even see two weeks ago. We’ve got to give Stew some real credit for stealing value in the draft. In addition to these two, Brock Bowers is becoming arguably the TE1 for the rest of the season and Jameson “Evan” Williams is magnetically attracted to the end zone. The committee has placed a wager on Stewed C to make the final four at -150. Newark Street Stat: Jameson Williams has 6 career touchdown catches. The shortest one of those is 32 yards. Deep ball specialist.</p>

    <p>Sansa falls one spot this week after getting pancaked by Marvin’s Receiver Room. More on him later, but credit to the committee for calling Marvin’s moneyline in this column last week. Bye weeks and injuries robbed Sansa of Derek Carr, Kyren Williams, Jonathan “Zachary” Taylor and Brian Robinson Jr this week. Given he was missing all those horses we can’t hold this loss against him, and he only drops one spot. We still feel good about this team, especially his ascendant wide receiver duo of Zay Flowers and Tee Higgins.</p>
<p>Newark Street Stat: Zay Flowers is on pace for 94 catches so far this year. This would be the most catches any Ravens wide receiver has had in the Lamar Jackson era. Only 2021 Mark Andrews has had more catches in the Lamar era.</p>

    <p>Piss got his wish last week when he faced his first adversity of the season. After tumbling from the 1st to 5th spot in the rankings, Piss gave a rousing pregame speech before his guys earned a hard-fought win against the hated rival AI Coke Twins. The most impressive part was that he pulled it off with Patrick Mahomes on bye and Dak Prescott playing like a demented raccoon. Chris Godwin channeled his inner Greg Jennings and put the team on his back in a monstrous performance. Additionally, Evan Engram was back in the lineup and looking like a target hog. Committee once again proving we employ Nostradamus as we called the Engram breakout last week. Newark Street Stat: Since Andy Dalton entered the lineup in week three, Diontae “Colonel” Johnson is 3rd in the league in total targets behind Garrett Wilson (who’s being force fed the ball by an elderly Aaron Rodgers) and Drake London.</p>

    <p>Marvin salvaged his season with a dominant win over Sansa last week. AOC may suck at football, but having a 2nd QB to toss in the lineup next to Lamar “Andrew” Jackson AKA the Indian despiser is invaluable. Lamar had 19.92 points, and it was considered an underperformance by 12 of our 15 models. He is the reason Marvin has a chance to make the playoffs even at 1-4. The Alexander “James” Mattison stuff is a bit much for us because he’s terrible at football. The good news is that Zamir White is 1000x worse so Mattison will continue to receive the lion’s share of touches in that Raiders backfield.

    <p>Gorlock drops two spots this week, but that has more to do with improvement elsewhere than anything bad with his team. Pulling out a win over Cap Stoppers with Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison out speaks to the depth he has cultivated. There is concern with how invested he is in the Browns running back situation because Deshaun Watson is playing statistically as badly as any quarterback this century and Nick Chubb is expected to reenter the lineup soon. Neither bodes well for Jerome Ford or D’Onta Foreman. It might not matter though if Kenneth and Jim can continue to elevate each week.</p>
<p>Newark Street Stat: On Sunday night, Joe Burrow ran 47 yards for a touchdown in the first half. This is the longest TD run by a quarterback in Bengals history.</p>

Bijan finally found the endzone, Chase Brown is solidifying his role as the RB1 in Cincinnati and Tony “Soprano” Pollard is just an absolute bellcow. Receiver remains a weak spot and Shot is running numbers to continue to address that position going forward. Big matchup against Sansa Ludacris next week with both teams coming in off a loss. Newark Street Stat: Andy Dalton had 16.94 points against Atlanta. This would be the 3rd best performance of Bryce Young’s career.

    <p>Sweeney takes a brutal loss to Stewed C this week as he went into Monday night with a 5- point lead before Garrett Wilson did it to him. We have it on good authority the phrase “WDHDITM” was uttered late Monday night after Wilson gave Stewed C the lead. Nonetheless, this team is playing well. After looking like Eddie Lacy for the first couple of weeks, D’Andre Swift has turned it around to average 21.6 points over the last three weeks. Nobody on the committee saw this one coming. We had written Swift off to the point where we thought he’d be selling mud in West Philly this time next year. Credit to Monroe Street for never abandoning hope. The Nico Collins injury hurts but the intel we have out of Houston suggests he’ll only be out 4 weeks. This will give him plenty of time to be in peak shape for the playoff push. Newark Street Stat: An all time order was placed at Lorenzo’s Saturday night. Receipts acquired by the rankings committee using a FOIA request show two large veggie pies, a two liter of Sprite and a side of wings were ordered at approximately 1:13am late Saturday night for a total of $43.67. Our investigative unit pulled the tapes from Lorenzo’s security feed Monday afternoon and saw a man roughly 25-30 years of age, Caucasian, with hair. Tough to say who this might be.</p>

    <p>The Stoppers fall a couple of spots this week after a tough performance. The separation from 7-11 is very slim so this isn’t a huge indictment. The trouble for Cap Stoppers is Travis Etienne stinks. And he was expensive. This dickhead is getting outperformed significantly</p>
<p>by Tank Bigsby over the past month. The hope for Cap Stoppers is that Tua’s impending return could skyrocket De’Von Achane back into fantasy prominence to offset the poor play from Travis Etienne. Having said that, Baker Mayfield is nasty. Mayfield is averaging the 2nd most points per game of any player in the league right now behind only Lamar Jackson. He’s even ahead of media darling Jayden Daniels. Newark Street Stat: Chat, is Rodgers cooked? Since his MVP season in 2021, Aaron Rodgers has exactly one game over 20 fantasy points and that was week 3 against the Patriots this year. Across his two MVP seasons in 2020-21 he had 24 games over 20 fantasy points. (Editor’s note: we wrote this before Monday night football and Rodgers actually played pretty well. Not cooked yet.)</p>

    <p>Work Ass falls to 1-5 on the backs after Tyler Bass and Braelon Allen put up 5.8 combined points Monday night. The running back situation here leaves much to be desired, but he is making it up for it with stellar receiver play. Drake London has been a target monster since a lackluster week and has scored in 4 of the past 5 games. Meanwhile, Tank Dell had a season high in points and targets as he became a focal point of the Texans’ offense with Nico Collins sidelined. Dell’s stock has risen massively in the short term. At 1-5 Work Ass faces an uphill battle to make the playoffs but he’s also nowhere near the cellar dwellers of the league. Newark Street Stat: In 8 starts from last season to this season, Joe Flacco is averaging 20.65 points per game. This would be good for QB4 so far this season and QB5 last season. Imagine being Anthony “Hopkins” Richardson right now.</p>

Even cement boots got in on the action with 19.2 points. All of this added up to a massive blowout of WHERESTUA. It was the rarely seen but highly praised doubling up of the opponent. Newark Street Stat: While Homo Williams has looked great in recent weeks, the committee would like to pump the breaks a little. The past 3 weeks, the Bears have beaten 3 of the 4 worst scoring defenses in the league.</p>

Malik Nabers should be back soon; Josh Downs is a stud and the gay kid has been banned from McSwiggans due to some expert politicking by Senior AI and his posse. On the flip side, he had a real chanceto win this matchup if he had started Keenan Allen instead of Taysom Hill (who was inactive) in his superflex spot (until Breece Hall popped off Monday night). Not to overstep, but several on the committee believe there should be some sort of penalty for failing to set a full lineup in a given week. One punishment suggestion was only eating at Black Bear for a month. TBD on what the commissioner decides is appropriate. Newark Street Stat: Josh Downs has a 28.6% target share since returning to the lineup. This is a top ten number in the entire league. Joe Flacco is absolutely feeding this guy.

    <p>Tua may have taken a brutal loss this week, but our models actually upgraded him significantly based on what we saw. For one, good news on the Tua front as Mike McDaniel confirmed he expects to see Tua in uniform again this season. While it’s unlikely WHERESTUA will make playoffs, this is excellent news when it comes to the playoff bracket. In the short term, the Stefon Diggs outlook is very nice with potential WR1 upside weekly for as long as Nico Collins is out. Should Justin Fields get benched, this outlook could improve even further. Newark Street Stat: Among receivers with at least 30 targets this season, Diggs ranks 5th in catch rate at 77.1%. He has been extremely reliable for CJ Stroud. This is surpassed only by Chris Godwin, Jamarr Chase, Jayden Reed and Josh Downs.</p>

    <p>We’re lumping these two together because it’s genuinely difficult to tell which team our models despise more. Even if you combined the best parts of both teams, our model would only have them 13th in these rankings. It’s borderline impossible. We will credit Gotham for landing two great QBs. Stroud and Kirk have performed admirably. Due to injuries and general piggishness, there’s not another human being on this roster I would trade for. The highest scoring non-QB in Gotham’s lineup was Austin Seibert (he plays kicker). And don’t even get me started on Ger. Actually, now that we’re taking a closer look Ger’s team is better than Gotham. Just flipped the two. Is seeing Tre Tucker in the lineup insane? Absolutely. But Amon-Ra balls out, Tyrone “Bill” Tracy Jr is clearly a suitable replacement for Devin “Mike” Singletary and Cole Kmet might be a top five tight end. This is mostly close because the Will Levis stuff is unbelievable. Going up against a Colts defense that was just shredded by Trevor “Noah” Lawrence, he couldn’t even throw for 100 yards. I’d rather have Jake Fromm. Newark Street Stat: Alright, you get a double dip here. Darius “Rucker” Slayton has 22 targets over the past two games. This ties his career high in a two-game stretch dating back to 2019. Daniel Jones has been feeding Darius in Malik Nabers’ absence. Also, the committee was shook seeing Slayton has been on the Giants for 6 seasons. What an era of Giants football. This one is courtesy of a nice gentleman from twitter named Michael Nania: Allen Lazard has the worst drop rate of any receiver in the league in each of the past two seasons. His drop rate is more than triple the league average for a receiver. And that is Gotham’s WR1 going forward. And yet somehow Lazard decided to catch 6 of 7 targets including a Hail Mary on Monday night.</p>
