<div class="intro"><p>Sound Familiar? Some things just don’t change in this league huh? Matt drafts Tua, Joey takes a million Eagles and Ger’s team sucks cock. It’s tradition at this point. After an absolute pigfest of a week one, a lot has changed from the committee’s preseason predictions. Let’s get into it. I’m writing this before MNF so I started with the worst teams and worked my way up. (Update after MNF: That game stunk. Didn’t change any of the committee’s opinions.

    <p>Work Ass might have cracked the code. We can already hear North Willow St. punching the air making wild claims about “HoW iS hE aBoVe mE” after the results of their matchup this week. It’s important to remember the committee analyzes numbers beyond the scoreboard. Bo “Jangles” Nix and Trevor “Saint” Lawrence combined for only 20 points and Work Ass still put up a respectable showing. The main reason we have Work Ass #1 is because we think he nailed all of his sleeper picks. Emeka “Okafor” Egbuka, Ricky Pearsall, and Bill Merritt all look like locks. He paid a combined $23 for those guys. JSN looks like he’ll be a target hog for Sam Darnold in Seattle and Chase “Emmett” Brown is the bellcow in what should be one of the best offenses in the league. Having said that, Nix and Lawrence will need to pick it up. Their performances on Sunday are not going to cut it. We don’t know if these guys will be top ten QBs, but the expectation is they’ll be top half. If they can live up to that, Work Ass is going to have a very nice season.</p>

    <p>Stewed might be back with another outstanding team. After dominating much of last season, Stewed flamed out early in the playoffs. Intel out of Jefferson suggests he walked around with a hatchet for a week after that. Good news is that frustration led to significant motivation and he spent the offseason optimizing his draft approach. Early signs are pointing to a big payoff for Stewed.</p>
<p>Since Jalen Hurts became the full-time starter in 2021, he’s been no worse than 6th in points per game for QBs. Reliability is elite. Derrick “King” Henry just showed on Sunday night how good he still is. Trying to tackle him is like trying to prevent Jefferson from touching bag in Boston. Furthermore, Stewed got good value on Stafford, Devonta Smith and Garrett Wilson. We don’t have much faith in his depth but Stewed has some nice starters and two dominant guys in Hurts and Henry.</p>

    <p>He doesn’t deserve it. Mickey Mouse POS bid up Josh Allen and then complained when he actually got him. I’m ruined. Having said that, the committee remains impartial. Josh Allen has finished top 2 in total QB points for five straight seasons and he was QB1 in three of those seasons. He’s the greatest player alive. When you pair that with Bijan Robinson “Cano”, Bucky Irving and an ascending Michael Penix this team might really be something. We think he hit on some low-cost receivers in Keenan Allen and Khalil Shakir plus we like his dart throws with Elic Ayomanor and Isaac TeSlaa. Ayomanor put Travis Hunter in a blender on a Friday night two years ago. If you despise Hunter, great watch. The success of this team likely hinges on how good Penix can be. If Penix is a legitimate top 10-12 QB, this team is going places.</p>

    <p>Some, not me but some, were cooking Ginny Sack’s draft strategy while he wasn’t there to defend himself. It’s a little soon to declare victory, but Ginny might have found an alternate investment strategy that could lead to league domination. While others blew cash on QBs, Ginny guzzled beers and waited patiently, capitalizing on potentially depressed valuations for Christian McCaffrey, Drake London and Brock Bowers. There is certainly some risk in this as he’s rostering one real human being at quarterback. That human is Kyler Murray and he looked sharp on Sunday, but Tyler Shough as QB2 is the type of stuff Rutgers would roll out. Ginny is betting that a well-rounded roster can compensate for a bad superflex. This generally goes against the committee’s philosophy, but after one week we’re starting to buy what this team is selling.</p>

    <p>Speaking of darts, the son of Jack, Jaxson Dart figures heavily into the upside of CMGC. His lineup has few weaknesses and the Flacco/Dart combo for QB2 figures to be functional at a minimum. Baker has turned into a TD machine, Ladd is the best Caucasian receiver in the league, and the Jeanty-Achane duo could be electric. CMGC even bet on the Kyle Pitts resurgence. Credit to him. As with everyone, injuries are a concern, especially to a concussion magnet like Chris Olave. Still, this team is probably -180 to make the playoffs right now.

    <p>For the 2nd straight year, Gorlock’s team rests almost entirely on the fate of four dudes. But those 5 dudes might be nasty. CeeDee Lamb looked like a potential WR1 overall candidate in dicing up the eagles last Thursday. If he didn’t have a case of the drops, we’d likely have been looking at 14 catches for 230 yards. Amon-Ra had an ugly first game, but he’s been highly reliable in his career so far and gets the benefit of the doubt from the committee. Jordan Love is the quarterback for what we expect to be the best team and one of the highest scoring offenses in the NFC. Couple him with maybe the sleeper of the draft Justin “Landry” Fields and Gorlock really has something cooking.

    <p>Deal’s draft appears to be a bit of a mixed bag after week one. Let’s start with the bad. Tua looked like Zaukas blindfolded. If that continues, he’s cooked. JJ “Joseph” McCarthy shook off an awful start to finish strong. Investing heavily in 3 QBs and having two be poor would not be great for Deal. However, the committee is of the mind that Tua has enough track record to call week one a fluke. The combination of Tua and Justin Herbert could be scary. And with McCarthy in the mix, Deal might have better QB options than anyone. Breece “Carnegie” Hall looked outstanding in the new look Jets offense. If he becomes the RB1 many expected last year, Stewed C is going to be quaking in his boots. Additionally, the committee would be remiss if we didn’t mention that Deal might have stolen two starters in Javonte Williams and Deebo Samuel for $4 each. Deal hopes to avoid the slow start that plagued him last year before he went on a run in the second half of the season.</p>

    <p>If Daniel Jones is going to look like an MVP candidate, this is way too low. We don’t buy that yet though. Our projections assume he’s going to be a top 20 QB going forward though and that’s pretty damn good for the measly price of $21. Daniel was far more strategic with his spend this year than in years past. Many still bring up the “can we get more money incident” of 2022. It’s clear this front office has evolved its approach since then. He bet big on three young studs in Jahmyr “Mister” Gibbs, BTJ, and Jayden Daniels and then filled out the roster with some CHEAP flyers. Credit to Daniel for executing his approach to perfection. Daniels is awesome. We don’t know if he’s quite on the Lamar and Josh level every week, but he’s clearly right behind them with Hurts. After the big week one win, the front office saw fit to make 49 lbs. of pulled pork for the team. Reports from Hudson Street revealed that Shedeur Sanders said he doesn’t eat pork.

Some have argued he’s more interested in podcasting with Tucker Carlson than throwing touchdowns. Not great. However, if those two clowns get it figured out the rest of this team has dudes. Omarion Hampton and Alvin Kamara look great. The depth Derrick has at receiver might be unmatched in the whole league. And Hockenson has Gallo’s hair.

Nico Collins missed a huge piece of time last year and his QB situation is becoming iffier by the week. And as good as Puka is, the committee has injury concerns with him too. Assuming health, we like the core of this team. The real issue with Sweeney. is the running back position. These backs flat out stink. Rhamondre and Bhayshal Tuten are his starting running backs?

    <p>Let’s start with the good news. Saquon “Charles” Barkley remains one of the best football players alive and Aaron Rodgers looks like he does in fact still have a pulse (credit to him). Beyond that, committee is a little skeptical. Mike Evans had a slow day, but he’ll be fine. The trouble starts with Kenneth Walker. He was essentially in a split backfield with Zach “Carbonara” Charbonnet and you can’t pay $28 for a guy who’s going to split carries all year. Committee is very concerned about Walker going forward. Beyond that, AI Coke has a whole lot of $1 mongoloids. Rachaad White? Carries Bucky’s jockstrap. Rashod Bateman? Deep ball specialist. Adam Thielen? Washed. Jayden Higgins?

    <p>Was he kidding with that draft? The man spent real US dollars on Russell Wilson and Pittsburgh’s backup running back. Nabers might be the best receiver in the world, and it won’t matter as long as Mr. Unlimited is under center. One anonymous league member went as far as to say “this team might be worse than when he spent $125 on Tyreek Hill. What a freak.” That was a bit harsh but the point stands here. Ger’s best player is quite clearly Malik Nabers and without a significant improvement at the QB position, it’s hard to see Nabers living up to his $45 cost. Additionally, the strategy of going with bad QBs again is not something the committee looks favorably upon. But that seems to be the MO for this team. He did sneak into the playoffs last year so perhaps he’ll prove us all wrong again. Until then, he’ll occupy the bottom spot of these rankings.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-best-pick"><span class="callout-label">Best Pick:</span> It’s early but Ger might’ve stolen value on two players. Travis Etienne looks like
the bellcow of Liam Coen’s new offense for only $8. Considering what Bucky Irving “Fryar”
did last year in Coen’s offense, Etienne has serious upside. Additionally, Keon “Derrick”
Coleman put on a clinic last night. If Ger got Josh Allen’s WR1 for $4 he’s going to feel pretty
good about that.</div><div class="callout callout-worst-pick"><span class="callout-label">Worst Pick:</span> Let’s be reasonable. Mr. Unlimited.</div>
