<div class="lookback-intro"><p>As we finish up the 4th year of the league, the committee thought it prudent to lookback and summarize the first four years of the league and grade everyone’s performance. We’ll be comparing each league owner to a US president. Given the accusations of bias from certain corners of the league, we devoted some time to developing a proprietary algorithm to properly rank these teams. Chat “Chuck G” GPT assisted with the math here. The algorithm is like the old BCS formula in that its on a scale of 0-1 and is sure to infuriate some people. Without further ado, let’s discuss the basics of said algorithm. Each team is assigned a Power Score that combines regular season performance, scoring strength, playoff resume and historical shame for finishing in last place. Each stat is normalized so the different scales are comparable and then the formula weights them as follows: • Win Percentage- 40% o Regular season only. We’re not giving double credit for playoff wins. • Points For- 35% • Point Differential- 5% o Strong defense deserves a little boost • Playoff Success- 30% o 3 points per championship o 2 points per finals appearance o 1 per semifinal appearance • Penalty for last place finishes All of the above is combined into a single Power Score, which determines the rankings. The results reward scholars. Please see the far right column. (Note: Zaukas and Boyle had a tie so there’s one less game for them)</p></div>

  </div>
  <div class="lookback-writeup"><p>Sweeney’s metrics are strong all the way around. He has three finals appearances in four years with two championships to show for it. After sneaking in as the last team in the field this year, he thrashed the juggernaut Scampi and rolled to the title. Some would call him the most clutch performer in the league given his win percentage is tied for 5th best and points for are 8th best. He knows how to peak at the right time. That’s the sign of a great coach. Comparison: FDR. Like Franklin Delano, Sweeney has been clutch when it matters most. While FDR weathered the Depression and World War Two, Sweeney has delivered clutch victories when facing elimination like his 5 straight wins to end the season this year. Neither of them compiled stats in peacetime, they both dominated in high stakes situations.</p></div>

  <div class="lookback-writeup"><p>Deez has claimed one championship and another appearance in the semifinals but unlike Sweeney his regular season dominance is the main reason for his being ranked so high. Deez sports the highest win percentage in the league through four years with the 3rd most points for. He’s an offensive juggernaut who knows how to win games. While he was disappointed with his finish in 2025, there’s no doubt he’ll remain a fearsome opponent going forward. Comparison: Dwight “Deez” Eisenhower. Eisenhower and Deez both displayed calm, sustained dominance without chaos. Eisenhower presided over a clean stretch of economic growth in the 1950s which maps favorably onto Deez’s strong regular season performance year over year. Neither’s resume is built on flashy moments, just doing the small things day in and day out.</p></div>

As it sits, he looks like the early 90s Bills with three championship appearances and no titles. However, his resume is strong even without a championship. His three title game appearances match Sweeney’s for most in the league. He’s the only human to have made the playoffs in all four seasons. He’s tied for 3rd in win percentage and sits 4th in points for. Elite roster management will continue to be his calling card.</p>
<p>Comparison: Gerald Ford. Ford and Ron both have kept things stable but didn’t quite get the crowning validation of a title. Ford ascended to the Presidency but was never elected himself while Ron has reached the championship three times without claiming the crown.

  <div class="lookback-writeup"><p>Often compared to Nostradamus, Mitch can see around corners. It has led to three playoff appearances in four years and one title with a team that peaked at the perfect time last year. He is tied with Ron for 3rd best winning percentage and is 6th in points for. He often relies on the stars and scrubs strategy which can backfire when executed poorly. While a cut below the top three, he is firmly in 4th place here as nobody below him even has a championship appearance. Comparison: George H. W. Bush. Mitch’s legacy is built around one big defining win similar to Bush. Bush’s legacy hinges on the undeniable success of Operation Desert Storm. He didn’t dominate in all aspects but this one accomplishment is something history can’t take away and that’s how many view Mitch’s championship in 2024. Hasn’t always been dominant but he’s overall pretty solid with one crowning achievement.</p></div>

Still, he’s tied for 5th in winning percentage is one of only six humans to have made the playoffs three times. He won’t be firing his GM anytime soon. Comparison: James K. Polk. Polk profiles as a president who was very productive but somehow still feels a little underappreciated. Polk dramatically expanded US territory with the resounding victory in the Mexican-American War. He also negotiated with Britain resulting in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. This maps well to TJ’s dominance in points for (2nd most in the league) and his top-5 win percentage with three playoff appearances. Neither is among the most celebrated of their cohort, as each are less decorated than their stats would suggest.</p></div>

  <div class="lookback-writeup"><p>Oh man he is going to be PISSED when he sees this. Joey has two playoff berths and one semifinal in four years. He has the most points for in the league. And yet his winning percentage is under .500. He has the most points in the league and has the 11th best winning percentage. Let’s do a quick comparison. Ron is similar to Josh Allen. He balls out every year, puts the team in a position to win and has had some bad luck in big games which leads to him having no championships. Mitch is like Jalen Hurts. He’s been mostly good not great, and has one title because a super team with unbelievable talent carried him to the title. Joey is like Lamar Jackson. He puts up lots of points, the fans love him and each preseason bettors shower him with love. But when it comes down to it he isn’t very clutch. Again as a reminder, he has the most points for in the league over four years and his record is 27-29 in the regular season. I’d say he needs a new defensive coordinator but he’s only 6th in points against. Comparison: Woodrow Wilson. Wilson talked big and swung for the fences on big projects like the League of Nations, but the results didn’t fully pan out. Similarly, Joey’s rosters and ambitions have often warranted some big talk but the final results haven’t necessarily lived up to their initial billing.</p></div>

Given the way Ron and Sweeney have hogged chip appearances, two playoffs and one semifinal is about right for the 7th rated team in the league. Comparison: James Madison. Madison was smart, capable and the architect of some major US systems. Even people who don’t rank him among the best presidents must acknowledge he was solidly above average. That’s Chris to a tee. Solid metrics, competitive all the time, and a consummate professional.</p></div>

Still he’s got the best point differential in the league so deserves some credit. Comparison: William Henry Harrison. Harrison’s profile is technically successful. He has a solid resume and he won the presidency in a clean election, but he died a month into office. Think of that death as equivalent to Gallo’s last place finish. If either Harrison or Gallo didn’t have that one black mark against them, they might be considered among the greats.</p></div>

Our analysts say when he wins he wins small, but when he loses he loses big. Profound analysis from them, right? The thing the committee remembers most from TK was his absolute fleecing of Boyle in our inaugural season of 2022. People forget, but TK had the wherewithal to send Javonte Williams and Michael Pittman to Boyle in return for Derek Carr, a rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown, Nyheim Hines and Robert “Bobby Trees” Woods. Some were up in arms accusing Boyle of rigging the league and calling TK a “retarded pussy” but he held strong in his belief. He ended up losing to eventual champion Sweeney by .02 in the quarterfinals. Comparison: Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes lost the popular vote and became president in a razor thin result which is why he’s famous for winning small. Hayes’ presidency was essentially decided by recounts and disputed electors while most of TK’s wins end up happening in a similar vein. He eeks out 85-82 victories in the spirit of Rutherford B. but when he loses he ends up getting clobbered. Additionally, they’re both remembered for one big event. For Hayes, it’s the Compromise of 1877 which ended Reconstruction in the South in return for the Democrats accepting him as president. For TK, it’s his fleecing of Boyle in one of the great trades in league history.</p></div>
