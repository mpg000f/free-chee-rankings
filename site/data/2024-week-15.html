    <p>Some are probably furious about this ranking and frankly much of the committee is too. How can Stewed get pantsed by WHERESTUA in the season finale and still be ranked #1? Mostly because Drake “The Great White Hope” and Jayden Daniels were on bye. Due to some challenges for Derrick, Stewed is the favorite to win the title with a new horse in the race right behind him. Stewed C spent the entire season ranked in the top 4. He debuted at #1 in week 3 and ends at #1 in Week 15. Stewed has an 18% chance of winning the title.</p>

    <p>He’s been lurking most of the season hoping his team would round into the form at the right moment and it certainly has. In his last 5 games (excluding week 12 when everyone was on bye), he has averaged 140 points per game. This team is looking scary with Josh Allen decimating defenses unlike anyone since Genghis Khan and Chase Brown cementing himself as a top 5 running back in the league.

    <p>His run of six straight weeks at #1 in the rankings ended last week when Trevor Lawrence was nearly decapitated by Azeez Al-Shaair. This may have derailed his title run as well. It’s a testament to just how unstoppable Jamarr Chase is that Derrick remains ranked this high. Chase nearly completed quite the comeback against Gorlock by himself on Monday night. Lawrence’s injury has left Derrick with only one playable QB in Bo Nix. The Chase-Henry- Nix duo might be enough to carry him to the title anyway, but the algorithm doubts it. His chances of winning the title have dropped to 11%.</p>

    <p>Gorlock held off Derrick Monday night to get to 10-4 and earn the 3rd seed. He was remarkably consistent throughout the year, ranking between 2nd and 6th in every iteration of the rankings. With Kenneth Walker’s status in doubt, it’s harder to see a path to the title for Gorlock now. Joe Burrow, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison have held up their end of the bargain, but the rest of this team leaves much to be desired. Geno Smith has cracked 20 points only once since week 5. And when you have to start slobs like Jerome “Gerald” Ford and DeMarcus “Mrs.” Robinson, that’s just not going to cut it. Additionally, Gorlock benefitted significantly from an easy schedule as he had the fewest points against in the entire league. The algorithm gives him a 9% chance of winning the title.</p>

    <p>This is outrageous you might argue. “He’s in first place, how can he be 7th in power rankings!” some Mickey Mouse fans have been heard saying. Despite finishing 11-3, Pigs was only 6th in points for the year. Meanwhile, he had the 3rd fewest points against in the league. This spread mostly explains why the committee and algorithm are lower on Pigs than the standings might suggest. The good news for him is that Pigs gets to face off against the only team ranked lower in the playoffs. Furthermore, we just can’t get behind a team with Homo Williams. The algorithm gives Pigs just a 9% chance to take home the title.</p>

    <p>You might be wondering how the #1 consumer of moldy chipotle in the western hemisphere snuck into the playoffs. He won his last five games to go from 3-6 to 8-6 and secure the 8th seed. So, you could argue he is very hot right now, but if you look under the hood the committee and other assorted scholars agree that he benefitted from some serious schedule luck. Four of his last five opponents failed to exceed 101 points while Ger averaged 119 points over that stretch. He was good but hardly spectacular. And yet somehow, the algorithm gives him a 9% chance to win the title. Nobody gets. We will grant that it’s impressive a team that was ranked 11th or lower for the first ten weeks of the season somehow snuck into the playoffs.</p>

    <p>The Tishman. His team was flat out atrocious early in the season, but he seems to have found a groove in time to avoid consuming 947 burgers this January. The emergence of Jameis has certainly helped while Jordan Love and Tyreek have returned to form. AJ Brown despises Hurts with a passion so that could become problematic but the main area to monitor for Tishman is the health of Bucky Irving. Buck tweaked his back and is questionable this week against the Chargers. The algorithm gives Tishman a 10% chance of coming in last.</p>

<div class="special-section"><h2>Matchup Previews</h2><p>Playoffs (1) Pigs on the 7th Rank vs. (8) Ger As you may have noticed the 1-8 matchup is between the two teams with the lowest power rankings in the playoffs. Some on the committee have compared Pigs to the 2021 Tennessee Titans. They had a great regular season and earned the one seed, but will they hold up against elite competition in the playoffs? Having said that, we don’t think Ger is elite. His hot streak to end the season was fueled by some lucky defensive performances and we expect Pigs to end the run right here. Closer than some think though. Pick: Pigs wins 123.47-110.92 (2) Life with Derrick vs. (7) WHERESTUA What a matchup we’ve got here. Derrick has been consistently the best team all season but is now hampered by the injury to Trevor Lawrence. Meanwhile, Tua’s roster was in shambles in October and he’s now scorching hot. We’re going to ride the hot hand here as we expect Tua and Jonnu to keep it up. If Jamarr Chase drops 45, please forget the committee made this pick. Pick: WHERESTUA wins 133.03-127.84 (3) Gorlock the Destroyer vs. (6) Cap Stoppers</p>
<p>Another great matchup. The explosiveness of Gorlock’s top players is going to be a lot to overcome for Cap Stoppers. This game will likely be decided by who pops off in the Buffalo- Detroit game and if Chicago’s defense can limit Jefferson and Addison. Even with Kenneth Walker’s health in doubt, we give a slight lean to Gorlock. Credit to Gotham for having the lowest average ranking of any team throughout the year. Pick: Gorlock wins 122.31-115.49</p>
<p>(4) Stewed C vs. (5) Deserves to be Shot Some are calling this the matchup of titans. The top two teams in the power rankings face off with each other in the first round. The winner moves on to what they will certainly view as a favorable matchup against Ger or Deez while the loser shaves his head. The stakes couldn’t be much higher for this one. Stewed C likely has the higher floor here, but as we saw last week the upside of Josh Allen is limitless. If the Detroit-Buffalo game turns into a shootout, Stewed C will be in trouble. Otherwise, we favor Stewed C. Pick: Stewed C wins 145.17-139.63 Pig-off (9) Hand me the Piss vs. (16) Marvin’s Receiver Room This one ought to be a real barn burner. Neither of these teams is expected to hit 100 points. Between them, there will be 5 Cowboys on the field. Considering the Cowboys blow cock, this does not bode well. Marvin appears to be cornering the market on shitty Cowboys players with Trey Lance, Luke Schoonmaker and Brandin Cooks all rostered. We expect Adam Thielen to be the difference here. Pick: Piss wins 96.52-89.10 (10) Sweeney. vs. (15) Gotham Rogues This one is must see tv. These two storied rivals played an absolute slugfest three weeks ago with Sweeney. capturing a 94-83 victory. These are probably two of the better teams in this disgraceful tournament. Neither is likely to end up finishing last. Puka goes for 30+ again to help Gotham pull this one out. Pick: Gotham wins 109.42-101.23 (11) Sansa Ludacris vs. (14) Work Ass</p>
<p>Sansa’s roster is a playoff roster. Nobody really understands how he ended up here. The main concern for him is if Derek Carr can’t play, the only man uglier in the league will take his place. Based on current intel, we expect Sansa would keep Spencer Rattler on the bench if that turns out to be the case. Pick: Sansa wins 114.13-97.68 (12) Here Without You Tishman vs. (13) Senior AI Coke Twins Can you imagine? The Pride of McSwiggans faces off with Cork City’s #1 Despiser. The committee has heard rumors that Tishman has been saving something special for this matchup. Even still, Isaiah Davis is coming on strong for AI Coke and will be something to behold in this one. Tishman probably pulls it out. Pick: Tishman wins 106.44-96.22</p></div>
