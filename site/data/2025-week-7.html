    <p>After toughing out a close matchup against Work Ass, Art retains the top spot in the rankings this week. Even with some pigfest performances from Tua, Javonte and Breece Hall, Art was able to put up enough points to secure the win. George Pickens has been an absolute monster. Going into week seven, Pickens is the WR3 on the season. Dak and Pickens have some of the best chemistry the committee has seen since prime Stockton and Malone. It’ll be interesting to see if they can keep it up once CeeDee reinserts himself. Additionally, Josh Jacobs put up 29 points for the 2nd straight game and sits as the RB7 so far. Morale at Art’s HQ is high, but they’re remaining lowkey having been on deep playoff runs before to no avail. The goal is to peak in December. The coaches will do everything they can to keep stacking wins in the meantime but they have their eye on the ultimate prize.</p>

    <p>C-M-G-C, C-M-G-C, C-M-G-C. The crowd at swigs chanted in unison watching Achane, Ladd and others light up the scoreboard on Sunday. After a brutally bad first month, CMGC has won two straight and is well on his way to a turnaround. His decimation of Life with Derrick this week was so thorough that phone calls were being placed to the commissioner’s office asking CMGC to call off the dogs. Let’s get into the details. While the Dolphins may be incapable of winning, De’Von Achane is a threat to society. Achane is the RB4 in total points. Ashton “Kutcher” Jeanty has woken up with three straight games in double figures after a slow start. Ladd is following suit. Olave and Ferguson eat targets. This team is extremely well-rounded and now they might have a reliable QB2. Jaxson “Barkevious” Dart might be the chosen one. The prodigal son. The future of the franchise. Dart has put up 17+ in three straight weeks after taking over for the putrid Russell Wilson. Fans across the tristate area were smoking darts in celebration of Dart’s breakout after the win against Philadelphia last Thursday. According to some projections our intern stole from Phillip Morris HQ, they are projecting a 357% increase in cigarette sales in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut due to Dart’s ascendance.</p>

    <p>Monroe and North Clinton St are not going to like this one, but after grouping them together last week we couldn’t justify any differentiation after strong showings from both. Scampi put up 120 points. Ginny put up 126 points. Both moved to 5-1 and are separated by just 17 points after six weeks. Additionally, both might have more runway to improve than originally thought. Scampi is seeing subtle improvement from AJ Brown and Travis Kelce as both shake off the dust. Sam Darnold continues to look like the guy once considered to be the prince who was promised for the Jets. And it’s just fake how good Jonathan Taylor is. Ginny Sack’s roster is so well-rounded that he pulled out a win with zero quarterbacks this week. Kyler Murray was hurt so Ginny had to slot in Tyler Shough at QB. Shough did not play a snap and Ginny was still able to slap up 126 points and take down Stewed C. Both Scampi and Sack have an 84% chance to make the playoffs. The model doesn’t love either’s chance to win the title because they have no QB2, but 4% chance for each isn’t terrible. For context, the model prefers Sweeney Deez and Zaukas chances to win the championship at 5% despite the fact his team is worse than the Onion Sandwich from Bubbakoos. Scampi Team Comp: 2012 Boston Celtics. A contender built around aging players who were once superstars (Kelce/Adams/Brown) with one in their prime monster (Taylor) who probably won’t win the title, but they’ll be a tough out. Ginny Sack Team Comp: 2017 Kansas City Chiefs. This is a very good team with a lot of talented players, but the lack of an elite QB is holding it back from being a true title favorite. Can he make a trade to improve before the deadline?</p>

    <p>Credit Work Ass for maintaining his ranking after losing a tough game against our #1 team. There was good news and bad news for Work Ass. Let’s start with the bad. Keeping Cam Skattebo on the bench cost him a win and could potentially keep him out of the playoffs down the line. Skattebo had 30 points while Chase “Retard” Brown and Bill Merritt combined for 13.2. Benching either one of those slobs in favor of Skattebo would’ve secured Work Ass the win. And that’s even with Emeka Egbuka getting injured and Rome Odunze getting shut down on Monday Night Football. Now on the flip side, Jaxon Smith-Njigba is unbelievable. He continues to evoke memories of his godlike performance in the 2022 Rose Bowl where he put up 15 catches for 347 yards and 3 touchdowns. JSN is now the WR2 on the season behind only Puka. Furthermore, Trevor Lawrence is showing signs of more consistency which will elevate Work Ass’ chances of a playoff run. Jake Tonges has been so good for Work Ass that Kittle may not get his job back.</p>

    <p>Team Daniel separated itself a little bit this week after pulling out a clutch win over the reeling Jackson Brownes. Despite playing both Jaydon Blue and Dalton Kincaid (zero points each), Team Daniel held off a furious Monday night rally from JB. When Josh Allen’s final pass was deflected and intercepted it sealed the deal. The return of Jayden Daniels coupled with a Brian Thomas Jr. breakout might be exactly what this team needs to break into the upper tier of contenders. The committee would like to see improvement in the coaching department before we elevate this team any further. Playing two guys slated for zero points is questionable coaching at best, especially when Justice Hill had fresh legs on the bench and there was a plethora of threatening tight ends on the wire to pick up. When reached for comment, a spokesperson from Team Daniel said, “We couldn’t afford to drop Shedeur or Emari Demercado. We have high hopes for both going forward.” While that doesn’t provide the committee with much confidence in their player evaluation department, at least it’s a plausible explanation. In any event, he moves to 4-2 and now has the 2nd highest odds of making the playoffs at 88%. Credit.</p>

    <p>The pitchforks and torches crowd will probably be outside HQ by the time you’re reading this. “How can he fall 5 spots after such a close loss, Mister Chairman!” I’m glad you asked. JB’s stars and scrubs strategy works great when the stars are dominating but injuries or poor performance from those top horses is what’s killing him. Bucky Irving is probably his 3rd best player, and he’s been on the shelf for the last two weeks with a strong likelihood of continued absence. Bam Knight is a decent fill-in but otherwise JB is rostering running backs who wouldn’t start for Riverdell. It’s like Trent Richardson’s retarded brother and the ghost of Brian Leonard. Additionally, after a hot start Keenan Allen is slowing down. Some in league circles are convinced these challenges are part of the reason JB didn’t leave his compound this weekend. Scholars are torn on if he was working on a plan to salvage the season or just sleeping all day. TBD. With Josh Allen on bye this week, we expect another loss and then he’ll have gone from league favorite to the playoff bubble in just three weeks. Having said all of that, this team is still anchored by Josh Allen and Bijan Robinson who are the QB2 and RB2 respectively through six weeks. As long as those two monsters are balling, it will be difficult to count out JB.</p>

    <p>Pigs moves up one spot after a confidence-boosting win over Ger. Ger flew all the way to Jersey just to get his smelly team smacked around by Rico Dowdle and Deez’ cupboard of criminals. It starts with Mahomes for Deez. After a couple of downs years fantasy wise, Mahomes is so back. Please see below.</p>
<p>With Mahomes back performing as the QB1, it makes things a whole lot easier for Pigs. Many compared Caleb Williams to Patrick Mahomes pre-draft and now we’re finally starting to see why as Williams has been the QB8 so far with Ben Johnson calling plays for instead of Damien Woody. With a formidable QB duo, Pigs has been able to focus on coaching up undervalued players like Rico Dowdle. Dowdle went for over 200 yards for the 2nd consecutive week to annihilate his former team. Chuba Hubbard is expected back at some point, but Dowdle may be too good to keep on the bench. Just an outstanding development story from Pigs’ coaching staff. This one alone should have him in the running for coach of the year come December. One other thing to note for Pigs is the improvement of Jaylen Waddle since Tyreek got hurt. It’s probably still a net negative for the team since he lost one of his starting receivers but it’s good to see Waddle isn’t completely cooked.</p>

    <p>This team isn’t particularly good, but at 4-2 they have roughly a 69% chance to make the playoffs. Mostly, we’ve used this section each week to bloviate about just how good Drake Maye, the next MVP of the NFL, is. And how could we not? You’re probably thinking okay good the committee will just talk about how shitty this team is now. If so, you’re sorely mistaken. Maye is 6th in total fantasy points among QBs so far this year while carrying a putrid offensive supporting cast. He’s 3rd in the league in EPA per dropback while having to combat the worst running game in the league. After sitting as high as 75-1 for MVP in the 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Patrick Mahomes Fantasy Performance Fantasy Points Per Game (FPPG) FPPG Rank preseason, Maye is now down to 10-1 on FanDuel. Now admittedly, he can’t carry Sweeney Deez and Zaukas quite like he can carry the Patriots, but it’s fun to discuss right? Outside of Maye, Dak Prescott is having the 2024 Joe Burrow season. He’s playing like one of the best QBs in the league while compensating for an abysmal defense and an owner with dementia. Additionally, the trade for Flacco may reenergize Ja’Marr Chase. Chase caught 10 of 12 targers for 94 yards and a tud in Flacco’s debut. If SDZ is to make a real playoff run, it will be on the backs of these three guys because the rest of the team is just mid to bad. Charbonnet, Pollard and Dobbins all rank in the low RB2-RB3 range.

    <p>After a reassessment of where we stand at this juncture of the season, Obama deserved a bump this week. His team may be bottom three in terms of a pure power rating, but with a 5-1 record he is weathering the injury storm like a pro. One anonymous league member went as far as to call him a modern-day Bill Cowher with how he gets the best out of the players he has on the field. The outstanding waiver wire pickup of Kimani Vidal coupled with an easy matchup against AI Coke helped move Obama to 5-1. He sits with a 79% chance to make the playoffs per our updated model. A best-case scenario likely involves Obama doing enough to squeak into the playoffs while Lamar and Burrow get healthy. Then he enters the playoffs with a fully operational team and pulls a couple upsets. The committee’s expectations are a bit more modest than this mostly because if the Bengals record doesn’t improve we find it unlikely Joe Burrow returns to the field this year.</p>

Ginny Sack waxed his balls this week to send him to 14th in the league standings ahead of only Life with Derrick and Senior AI Coke. From a pure power rating perspective, Stewed is 2nd in the league. Some good that will do him with this current record. He’s gotten solid to good play from most of his starters, but poor defense and a couple of tough coaching decisions have led to what might be a lost season. With the 3rd most points against in the league, perhaps he can fire his defensive coordinator and experience a bit of a bounce back.

    <p>The committee had a strong discussion about Ger this week. Despite the loss, was it time to put some respect on his name? The consensus was yes, we’ve been undervaluing Ger’s team for most of the year and without the stench of Russell Wilson lurking around, we can now more clearly and rationally evaluate this team. Goff is rock solid, Rattler is a viable QB2, Metcalf and Etienne have performed admirably. Is this team going to win any beauty contests? Of course not, but they’re a lot closer to a fringe playoff contender than the cellar dwellers Gorlock and AI Coke. While we stand by our questioning of Ger’s draft strategy, we must acknowledge it’s been a great in-season coaching effort to maintain a .500 record. He’s still 4th to last in points so we don’t want to hand out any medals. The return of Rashee Rice is a big pivot point. If Rice can perform as a top ten WR like many on this committee believe, it’s very possible Ger will be making a return trip north in 8 weeks for a playoff matchup.</p>

With the 3rd fewest points scored, there just hasn’t been enough firepower for the committee to get excited about this crew. Let’s start with the case of Cam Ward. It’s been an abject disaster from day one in Tennessee. See the below chart for just how bad it’s been.</p>
<p>Since 2015, there’s been nine quarterbacks drafted #1 overall. Only one before this year averaged less than ten points per game in his first six starts. That was Jared Goff under the direction of the dinosaur Jeff Fisher. Obviously, Goff has gone on to have a very nice career, but his rookie year is among the worst ever for a #1 overall pick. It won’t provide Sweeney. much comfort to see that Cam Ward’s production has been in line with Goff’s through their first six career starts. Between Ward’s performance and the decline of Geno Smith, Sweeney. never had a chance at QB. Without functional QB play, he’s been unable to take advantage of monster production from Puka Nacua and Quinshon Judkins. It’s sad to see for a once-proud franchise. Nonetheless, it is good to see Rhamondre Stevenson continue to perform like the stone cold RB1 he’s always been. Against New Orleans on Sunday, Rhamondre “DeShawn” Stevenson translated 13 carries into 18 yards. Credit where credit is due.</p>

Fields passed for 45 yards on 17 pass attempts and was sacked 9 times for -55 yards. Therefore, the Jets had -10 net passing yards. The Patriots found another franchise QB five years after the departure of Brady, while the Jets continue to recycle Walter Hudson clones at QB. What a sad state of affairs. Amon-Ra and CeeDee continue to be just about the only bright spots for Gorlock. CeeDee will return to the field soon, but his return won’t be enough to offset some of the cardboard disgracers elsewhere on this roster. For example, Chris Rodriguez Jr sounds like he would be an excellent second basemen. As a starting running back, he leaves much to be desired.</p>

    <p>Probably the committee’s favorite part of the week. Getting to cook this disgrace of a team. AI Coke has the fewest points in the league (obviously) and it’s not even close. He has 100 less points than the next person (Papi) which means he’s averaging nearly 17 less points per week than Papi. One could argue it’s because he didn’t set his lineup. That makes it even worse. Relegation discussions are in full swing as this 0-6 team makes a mockery of the Free Chee league office. The best part is the talent on the roster isn’t even that bad. He’s definitely been hurt by Mike Evans and Brocky Purdy injuries, but when healthy this should be a decent team. A combination of mud-eating, bag and visits to Moonlight Spa have derailed the focus of this coaching staff and it’s likely to cost them a spot in the league next year.</p>
