    <p>Stewed destroyed Piss to put him on the brink of missing the playoffs. After a bit of a lull, it appears Stewed is back to his early season form heading into the playoffs. Led by a trio of rookies and arguably the gayest running back alive, this team is the clear favorite heading into the playoffs per the WSGC. He even scooped up Nick Westbrook-Ikhines for depth this week. Jefferson is riding high as we head into the playoffs.</p>

    <p>Things are looking less stellar for Derrick after this last week. He suffered his 3rd defeat of the season putting the #1 seed in jeopardy for him heading into the final week of the regular season. Furthermore, Azeez “The Terrorist” Al-Shaair may have scrambled Trevor Lawrence’s brain. Derrick was counting on Trevor to pair with Bo Nix in the playoffs, but some are saying Trevor has been “Tua’d”. We didn’t quite see Trevor throwing up gang signs but his health over the next two weeks is something we’ll be monitoring closely.</p>

    <p>Shot locked up a playoff berth this week defeating Cap Stoppers. This team hinges pretty much entirely on the quarterbacks and running backs playing well. But those guys are pretty good at football. Chase “Emmett” Brown is among the greatest backs to ever set foot in Cincinnati and Josh Allen has been playing coy most of the year so he can be prepared to end seasons in December.

    <p>The Stoppers may have lost but they remain a rock-solid playoff team and very much a championship contender. If he is to make a long playoff run, it’ll likely be spearheaded by the Gibbs-Achane duo. There’s been some rumblings that the triple tight end strategy might be pulled out in case of an emergency. Time will tell, but with Rodgers releasing DMT documentaries on Netflix, it can’t be ruled out that Cap Stoppers would bench him.</p>

    <p>For as good as his record has been this year, the model has just never loved Pigs, giving him only an 8% chance to hoist the trophy. WSGC gives him better odds to win it all at +950. Time will tell who’s right, but with Stafford and Homo Williams operating at close to peak form right now, Pigs has got to feel good about his chances. Additionally, Mixon/Najee/Conner have all been top-20 backs over the last 5 weeks.</p>

    <p>What was once a promising season looks likely to fizzle out for Piss. After a 6-3 start, he’s dropped 3 of 4 to fall to 7-6. Given tiebreakers it’s still very likely he makes the playoffs but Stewed or Derrick would not be nervous to draw this matchup. The injury to Dak Prescott and the sidelining of Jordan Mason when CMC returned all but cooked him. Several committee members confessed they sprinkled on Piss to miss playoffs at +290.</p>

    <p>Credit to this retard. He weathered quite the injury storm between Pacheco, Kupp and others but has come out with a legitimate chance at making the playoffs. Sitting at 7-6, he’ll need a win and some help. The model gives him roughly a 38% chance to make playoffs. Considering he was 3-6 a month ago, this is borderline miraculous. The only chirp we have is he legitimately cut Bryce Young and now the pride of Alabama is riding pine on WHERESTUA’s bench instead of starting for Ger.</p>

    <p>Mathematically, he’s not eliminated but if we’re being realistic, he’s as cooked as Boyle’s homemade clam chowder. After a 4-1 start and a couple of well-timed chirps in the ear of Stewed C, Sweeney. has gone 2-6. Injuries to Nico Collins and others have hurt him dearly, but until last week the model still looked favorably upon his chances of making the playoffs. Textbook example of sometimes great strategy just doesn’t come to fruition.</p>

    <p>What happened to this guy? As recently as October we had Sansa in the top 5 of these rankings. His roster looked stacked. Even now, we really like his roster. 7 losses in the last 8 weeks is downright abysmal. Some (not the committee but some) are saying this is one of the worst chokes since the 2011 Red Sox blew their 9-game lead in the standings in September. The good news for Sansa is the model still finds it quite unlikely he’ll finish in last place.</p>

    <p>Tishman came out of nowhere this week to drop 177 points. He’s now averaging 157 points per game over the last two weeks. Led by Bucky Irving and Jameis Winston, nobody wants to see this red-hot team in the pig-off. After the disastrous last place finish in 2023, some are arguing that a strong finish is the only way Tishman will get to keep the head coaching job next year. We like his odds.</p>

    <p>Another megapig who has turned his season around after a pretty terrible start. Coke was 1-6 before ripping off 3 wins in his last 6 to become a regular bad team instead of an awful team. It seems like right when his team got on a roll, the injury bug hit again. Doesn’t help that Travis Kelce is more interested in being a zookeeper than catching the football these days. Definitely some real last place potential for Coke.</p>

<div class="special-section matchup-section"><h2>Matchup Previews</h2><p>Gotham Rogues vs Pigs on the 7th Rank Pigs is playing to secure a top two seed, but his worst case is falling to the 4 seed. Gotham is playing for pride I suppose. Stakes in this matchup are very low. Commissioner’s office has little reason to worry about foul play in this one. Our pick: Pigs by 17 Here Without You Tishman vs Marvin’s Receiver Room This one has even lower stakes. Both these teams are already thinking about draft positioning for next season, but Tishman at least is on a hot streak while Marvin barely has a roster to field. Our pick: Tishman by 50 Senior AI Coke Twins vs Sweeney. Sweeney. in theory has a fraction of a chance to make the playoffs, but in reality it’s pretty much impossible. He would have to win this matchup, have at least two of Piss/Tua/Ger trio lose and outscore them to make playoffs. Outscoring Ger is semi-reasonable because Sweeney. is only 63 points behind but he’d have to outscore Tua by 145 this week. We call cap. Our pick: AI Coke by 12 Deserves to be Shot vs Work Ass Deserves to be Shot has locked up a playoff berth pretty much. The only way he could possibly miss is if Piss/Tua/Ger all win and Ger outscores him by 114 points this week. Unlikely. And even with a win Deserves to be Shot can’t feasibly rise higher than the 5 seed (currently 6th). Stakes very low here as Work Ass is eliminated. Our pick: Shot by 33 Ger vs Sansa Ludacris This one has some real juice. Ger is playing for his playoff life while Sansa plays spoiler. Currently in 9th place, Ger’s path to the playoffs is fairly straightforward. He needs to win this one and have either Piss or Tua lose. That would get him in with an 8-6 record. Sansa is eliminated but still holds a grudge from when Ger did not shower for a month in 2020. You can bet he wants revenge here. Our pick: Ger by 5 Gorlock vs Life with Derrick This one is strictly for seeding as both these teams are locked into the playoffs. Gorlock has an 87% chance to be either the 4 or 5 seed while Derrick could be anywhere from the 1-3 seed. Given the injury to Trevor Lawrence, we expect Derrick to want to lock up the #1 seed and secure an easier path to the title. Our pick: Derrick by 14 Cap Stoppers vs Hand me the Piss This is a big one. Can Stoppers eliminate Piss from the playoffs? Stoppers has a 72% chance of being the 5 or 6 seed so he doesn’t have much to play for, but our intel suggests he would be thrilled to knock Bloomfield #1 out of the playoffs. Piss on the other hand needs a win to clinch a playoff berth. Without a win, he’ll be at the mercy of Ger and Tua’s results. Still a heavy favorite to make the playoffs as of now (see below). Our pick: Cap Stoppers wins by 22 Stewed C vs WHERESTUA This is the one. Matchup of Titans. Rivalry of Despisers. For all the marbles. Stewed’s worst case is the 4 seed, but with a win and some help from Derrick losing he could get the 1 seed. Tua needs the win to clinch a playoff berth. Otherwise, he’ll need at least one of Piss or Ger to lose and beat them in a points tiebreaker for the last playoff spot. For the first time since September he’s favored to make the playoffs. We think Tua and Jonnu combine for 55 to win this one. With any luck, we could see a playoff rematch next week. Our pick: Tua by 0.57</p></div>
