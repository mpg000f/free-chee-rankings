    <p>We have more concerns about JB this week than we did last week. The committee is willing to concede we may have overrated Michael Penix. Please see the tweet below for what exactly Penix looked like on Sunday. Getting shut out by the Carolina Panthers should be grounds for immediate contract voiding. The past time the Panthers won in a shutout was only a couple of months after the infamous Jack Black debate club. Having said that, the rest of this team is elite. Josh Allen beats the Dolphins more consistently than Tyreek beats his wife, Bijan is so good he managed 14 points even with Penix playing like Ridder, and Keenan Allen is playing like it’s 2017. JB really ought to look into rostering Kirk Cousins just in case.</p>

    <p>The top two in the rankings this week cement themselves as the clear top tier. Both moved to 3-0 with resounding wins and Big Gin may have found himself a QB2. Wentz was everything McCarthy couldn’t be the first two weeks. Poised, polished and perfunctory. McCarthy was nervous, erratic and retarded. Obviously, Minnesota is heavily invested in McCarthy’s future but if they’re serious about winning games in 2025, Wentz should remain the starter. In addition to Wentz, the NFC West RB duo of McCaffrey-Kyren will carry this team forward. The rest of this team is looking solid if unspectacular, but the committee believes in the upside. Drake London and Tetairoa each have 27 targets in three games. That’s tied for 6th among wide receivers through three weeks. At some point, that has to translate to better production (even if Penix and Bryce are retarded). Furthermore, it’s been a slow start for the TE1 in Vegas. That’s something we’ll be monitoring as Bowers is way too good to be this limited all year. A 3-0 record plus young players with upside leads to the 2nd overall ranking for Ginny Sack.</p>

    <p>Is he 0-3? Yes. Do Trevor Lawrence and Bo Nix look like Beavis and Butthead? Yes. Are his chances of making the playoffs diminishing? Yes (17%). Nonetheless, the model remains committed to Work Ass as a viable championship contender. Before your blood starts to boil (Monroe), at least hear the case. Nix and Lawrence gotta be able to put up 30 combined points per week, right? Even if one just reads the bible all game while the other shovels mud down his throat, 30 points should be manageable. Assuming Work Ass gets that, his receivers are almost just not even fair. Jaxon Smith “That Nigga”-Njigba is unbelievable. With a 40.3% target share, he is 1st in the NFL through three weeks. Sam Darnold is absolutely feeding him. When you add the Egbuka, Odunze and Pearsall trio to a WR1 like JSN, it’s borderline unstoppable. Now we already hear the counterarguments. “But Mr. Committee! He’s 0-3! They already have been stopped.” “His running backs can’t read and smell like shit! He can’t be ranked 3rd!” “I hope he dies in a fire. He’s such a faggot.” Some would argue these are valid complaints, but the committee remains confident in its model’s evaluation.

    <p>Deserves credit. Let’s start with where the committee was wrong. Below is a quote from one member of the committee last week (not me, but someone else): “In 2023 when Burrow was hurt, Browning averaged 18.75 points per game. Credit to Obama for ensuring he had Browning as insurance. Joe Burrow in his career averages 19.4 fantasy points per game. We expect limited drop off in fantasy output going from Burrow to Browning”- Week 3 committee rankings Bad start to that take. Browning got his ass handed to him on a plate by Brian Flores and the Minnesota defense on Sunday. We remain optimistic Browning can be functional going forward but “limited drop off” is a bit of a stretch. You got us on that one. Having said that, Obama still comfortably beat fellow bfieldmate, Pigs on the 7th after Lamar took control on Monday night. At 3-0 with Lamar Jackson, Jordan “George” Mason and Tyler Warren this team is close a playoff lock. The model gives them a 91% chance. We should take this opportunity to shit on Travis Hunter though. Through three weeks, Hunter has 12.6 points. And it’s getting worse.</p>

    <p>Stewed bounced back in a big way in week three. It was rivalry week with Hurts and Tua facing off and Stewed needed the win badly after an 0-2 start. Jalen Hurts finally removing his head from his ass was a big reason for Stewed’s win. With three 2nd half touchdown passes, Hurts led the Eagles back from a 26-7 deficit to beat the Rams. In his postgame press conference, Hurts was asked what he had to say to the haters. His response was illuminating. He said, “some people sleep all day, some people crank hog, and Willow couldn’t hold my sweaty jockstrap.” Wise words from the elder statesmen. Additionally, DeVonta Smith and Garrett Wilson finally woke up. If Tyrod Taylor continues to play for the Jets, Wilson’s stock is way up. Wilson is hogging a 39% target share so far which is good for 2nd in the league, and if Tyrod can accurately feed him the ball we’re looking at a WR1.

    <p>Deal falls two spots this week after a tough showing against his arch nemesis. Even still, the committee’s consensus is it was just an off week for an otherwise very good team. Herbert had a slow day against an awesome defense, but we have no doubt he’ll bounce back into the 20+ point range next week. Javonte, Breece and Josh Jacobs all went for their first single-digit outings of the year while Deebo saw only three targets with Marcus “Aurelius” Mariota piloting the Washington offense.

    <p>I mean this team is dangerous. Jonathan Taylor looks like the OPOY with his 2nd straight dominant game. Taylor has the 3rd highest share of snaps among RBs at 81% so far, clearly cementing himself as a workhorse. Combined with James “JC3” Cook, Scampi’s team will go as far as his running backs take him. However, he’s getting a real boost from Marcus Mariota. Mariota filled in admirably for Jayden Daniels this week and scored 20 points. As much as we’d like to manufacture a QB controversy, nobody would buy it in Washington. Therefore, this Mariota boost will likely be short lived, but the committee is confident in Scampi’s ability to work the wire and leverage QB injuries to his advantage. He continues to roster Anthony “Peanut Butter” Richardson in the hope that Daniel Jones will revert to his Giants form. Committee applauds the strategy. It was said that at McSwiggans yesterday, Morton convinced them to add Lobster Scampi to the menu in honor of Scampi’s 161-point outing.</p>

    <p>Much yet to be determined here. Drake Maye is confirmed him. Now averaging over 20 points per game through three weeks, he is tied for 6th in QB points. Considering Maye plays with a collection of criminals and Hunter Henry as his primary receivers, the committee rates him as a top-6 QB for the rest of the season. Going further on the positive side of things, Tony “Bernard” Pollard and JK Dobbins appear to be bellcows for their respective teams. Pollard leads the league in snap share at 90%. Historically, it seems SDZ management just has an eye for RB talent. Other managers have mentioned their admiration for their abilities in this department. Still, there are some concerns. Dak Prescott just lost his #1 WR for at least a month. Jamarr Chase is catching passes from Browning. Evan Engram and Zach Charbonnet appear to be busts. And yet, the model remains more optimistic than conventional wisdom would suggest. Its possible the Vikings defense is just that good and the Browning-Chase connection will be productive. Dak has found alternative methods of moving the puck with Jake Ferguson and George Pickens. Will it be enough? We’re not sure. But this team is 2-1 with Drake Maye. That’s enough for 8th.</p>

    <p>This ranking was the source of much debate in the committee room. Some wanted to rank them as high as 5th, but the more analytically inclined members of the committee suggested we proceed with caution. The model remains bearish on this roster. Before we get into the chirps, we have to give some credit. Puka is awesome. Through three weeks, Puka is WR1 overall and has the 3rd highest target share in the league at 38%. Stafford loves him. Quinshon Judkins can flat out ball. Not sure how much credit management deserves for the pick given autopick scooped him up, but he’s fairly good at football. And to top things off, Trey McBride is performing as well as any of the highly drafted tight ends. Now to the bearish side of things. CJ Stroud is so atrociously bad it makes the committee worried about the upside for Nico Collins for the rest of the year. Rhamondre Stevenson appears addicted to fumbling. He has had 9 fumbles since the beginning of last year, which leads all non-QBs. Vrabel benched him on Sunday, which is unfortunate because he looks pretty good when he’s holding on to the ball. In his first game with Jake Browning, Tee Higgins was targeted only twice. Like let’s be reasonable, Tuten has more targets this year than Higgins did with Browning in the game. At 2-1, they are a playoff contender but not one we would bet on. I would sell my shares.</p>

    <p>The chants of CMGC that followed him around Boston did not quite carryover upon his return to Hoboken. CMGC put up a pretty terrible 86 points against Sweeney Deez and Zaukas and lost by 18. There’s talent here but at 0-3 with the 11th most points in the league, he’ll need to mount quite the turnaround to be a playoff team. Despite expected regression from certain haters, Baker Mayfield continues to shine. He’s become remarkably consistent, with at least 17 points in every game but one since Tampa Bay’s bye week last year. The trouble lies elsewhere for CMGC. Ladd looks like WR3 on his own team as Herbert has pivoted to targeting players with slightly darker pigmentation. Stefon Diggs might have more baby mamas than catches this year. And Ashton “Kutcher” Jeanty cannot seem to break out. Some have argued that it’s because the Raiders offensive line is so bad but per Pro Football Focus, they’re just the 12th worst run blocking line in the league. Could be a lot worse than that. Perhaps Jeanty just isn’t the certified monster many predicted. CMGC does have a couple of target hogs on this team, so there is potential upside there. Neither is on a particularly explosive offense right now so we’re not sure it’ll translate to massive points. Chris Olave has the most targets in the league with 37 and Jake Ferguson is tied for 3rd with 32.</p>

    <p>We were going to rank this team 11th, but on a second look it couldn’t happen. Daniel Jones is a truck. He is carrying this team right now. Much of his fortune going forward will depend on the return and effectiveness of Jayden Daniels. Considering Daniels is 6’3” 145 lbs, some on the committee are nervous. We’re generally partial to beefy QBs like Jared Lorenzen and Jamarcus Russell. Daniels’ build is not quite on that level. More concerning is the collapse in production from Brian Thomas Jr. Through three weeks, there are 93 players who have run at least 50 routes this season. Thomas Jr. ranked 91st in catch rate at 28%. That is abysmal. Some scholars are blaming his collapse on the hire of the infamous Shane Waldron. For context, Waldron was the OC for Seattle two years ago (JSN’s rookie year where he looked like Joey) and he was the OC for the Bears last year (made Rome Odunze into me). JSN and Rome have been the 6th and 3rd best WRs in fantasy through three weeks this year. So, the curse of Waldron might be rubbing off on BTJ. Please see the clip at this link for what JSN thinks of Waldron. Jahmyr “Mister” Gibbs is pretty nasty though. At least this team has that going for it.</p>

    <p>Now we’re getting into some troubling teams. It comes back to Stroud and Bryce Young I’m afraid. After refraining from ripping them last week, we have to give them the business this time. Of quarterbacks who have played three full games, CJ Stroud is 4th to last in fantasy points. The three gentlemen worse than him? Michael Penix, Joe Flacco and Cam Ward. So two first time starters and a guy who peaked 13 years ago. Bryce is way less bad, so we’ll keep our chirps confined to Stroud. Many will remember how after his rookie year, Stroud took the liberty of ranking himself as a top five QB in the NFL. He ranked himself top five over Josh Allen. He also took it upon himself to give Caleb Williams a lecture after barely beating the Bears last year. See below for a useful graphic about Stroud’s performance before and after that lecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to start talking about Marvin Harrison Jr. on the all-time great bust scale. Harrison was pitched as the prodigal son of receiving prospects in the 2024 draft, and yet here he is week 3 of his sophomore season dropping two wide open touchdowns. After finishing 5th among rookies in receiving yards last season, he looks even worse now. It’s sad to see because there’s talent elsewhere on this roster. Omarion Hampton had a breakout game going for 21 points on 25 touches against a great Denver defense. Might be wasted playing with Ohio State scum like Stroud and Harrison.</p>

    <p>The competition for last was extremely intense between Ger and AI Coke. The committee would like to issue an apology for overreacting to the Giants week 2 offensive explosion. It turns out that the Cowboys defense is simply worse than Rutgers. Russ still stinks. In a 22-9 game last night, Giants had 1st and goal from the 4-yard line. The next four plays by Russ were: 1st down: intentional grounding out the back of the end zone 2nd down: QB draw for 4 yards</p>
<p>3rd down: Throw it out the back of the end zone again 4th down: throw the ball at the crossbar Is that generally what you like to see from your quarterback? Ger remains 2-1 based on winning that 71.42-70.76 slugfest in week 1 vs. Sweeney. but make no mistake this is a bad football team. Nabers, who I think we can all agree is very good at football, caught two of his seven targets last night for 13 yards. Having said that, there is some hope for Ger. While it’s inevitable that Russ will be benched, he does have Spencer Rattler on the bench. Rattler has been surprisingly functional and sits in 17th in QB points per game so far right between Matthew Stafford and Dak Prescott. Additionally, Rashee Rice is halfway home on his suspension and Mahomes should be giving that guy a 50% target share once he gets on the field. And lastly, Trey “Cedric” Benson just ascended to the RB1 slot in Arizona with James Conner’s season ending injury. So overall, we have to rip him this week based on principle but going forward this team has some upside and might improve with Russ’ benching.</p>

    <p>Senior Coke has some good running backs. Other than that, this team doesn’t have much. Some are questioning if he’s even actively managing the team or if he’s outsourced it to the group of Indian engineers he manages at Gong. He continues to play Tyler Bass at kicker despite Bass being on the IR. Seems like something the offshore engineering team would do. The real test will come this week. It’s very likely Mike “Bob” Evans will miss some time with a hamstring injury. Will Senior Coke swap him out? I’ll book bets on no at +110.</p>
    <div class="callout callout-next-up"><span class="callout-label">Looking Ahead:</span> With this administration’s focus on taking down drug smuggling boats, it’s
very possible the main performance enhancer available to Senior Coke’s players will
become of poorer quality. This bodes poorly for any hope of improvement. We reached out
to Scampi for his thoughts on next week’s matchup with Senior Coke and he said “Free win.
It’s a JV team.” Scampi opens at -17.</div>
