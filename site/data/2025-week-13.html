    <p>Scampi got his balls waxed by the proud sons of Bloomfield this week. So you may be wondering how he retained his #1 ranking? The simple fact is Jonathan Taylor was on bye and the committee can’t properly evaluate the squad without their fearless leader. Still, there are some concerns going forward. Sam Richard Darnold looked like he belonged in prison on Sunday. AJ Brown has three games in double figures all year. And Travis Kelce continues to be one of the more retarded pussies in our database. None of that is enough to override the fact that Scampi has Jonathan Taylor and James Cook to pair with unmatched QB depth as Marcus Mariota and Kirk Cousins appear to be starters for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <p>The committee gave serious thought to moving down Art, but he did enough with George Pickens and Javonte Dubs to squeak out a low-scoring win over Team Daniel on Monday night. There were two schools of thought in the committee room. School one: Herbert has Paul and Chris playing tackle for him right now and doesn’t stand a chance. JJ McCarthy or “Nine” (tough to say which one was playing Sunday) looks like a broccoli-haired version of Zach Wilson. And Josh Jacobs left the game with a knee injury and may miss some time School two: The Chargers can’t possibly look that bad again. George Pickens and Javonte are going to put up points in that Dallas offense. Breece Hall’s prospects improved with the benching of the mega retard Justin Fields. Deebo and Mariota seem to have a bit of a mind meld. And “Nine” is just getting started. The committee leans slightly toward school two so Art of the Deal stays at 2nd with his 8-3 record and 98% chance of making the playoffs.</p>

    <p>The committee was too disrespectful to Gin last week. He took care of business against Senior AI Coke in what many around the league were calling a “free win”. Credit him for putting up 137 points with zero quarterbacks. Christian McCaffrey and Kyren Williams continue to put this team on their backs while Gin finds oddballs to fill in where necessary. For example, Michael “Owen” Wilson had 15 catches for 185 yards on Sunday. Prior to Sunday, he had 21 catches on the year. Now people are asking if Marvin Harrison Jr. will even see the field again because Wilson is so good. Gin was so confident in his lineup decisions, he kept Tetairoa McMillan on the bench with 29 points. Against all odds, we might have a team win the league with dogshit QBs.

    <p>In what likely amounted to an elimination game, Work Ass took down committee darling CMGC 106-99. Both coaches got great defensive performances out of their respective teams and the Jake Ferguson/Ashton Jeanty combo couldn’t do enough to close the gap for CMGC. Work Ass now has a 47% chance to make the playoffs. Massive win for him. Nobody really popped off for Work Ass, but the team is looking sharp as we head down the stretch. JSN and Kittle might be the best in the league at their respective positions while Chase Brown is rounding into form at just the right time. With Ja’Marr Chase suspended, Brown might see even more touches. Lastly, Emeka Egbuka and Rome Odunze both had terrible days on Sunday, but that’s not something we anticipate becoming a trend. Both have been too good all year for the committee to worry about them now. They both remain top 15 WRs on the season. Next up is another titanic matchup for Work Ass as he faces off against rival Pigs on the 7th Rank. The animosity between these two might be relatively new but it is intense.</p>

    <p>He’s picking up steam. The model has him at an 87% chance to make the playoffs now. While some people were dumping bag and stuffing their faces, Pigs’ front office was making one of the shrewdest deals the committee has seen in quite some time. Some have called him a backstabber similar to Nico Harrison for trading a fan favorite like Homo Dubz, but the committee admires the gumption it took to pull off this deal and fulfill his team vision. Pigs sent Homo Dubz and RJ Harvey to Team Daniel for Jahmyr Gibbs. Gibbs is the RB5 on the year and a clear gamebreaker, so it was a great acquisition by Pigs since he has Jacoby Brissett waiting in the wings to take over as his QB2. In the last 5 games Brissett is averaging 21.9 points per game and actually outscoring HD. With Brissett locked in as the starter for the remainder of the season, we think Pigs’ bold move puts him in the inner tier of title contenders. Our model gives him the 3rd best title odds at 16%. The concern for him is he faces off with Work Ass this week. He’s a solid favorite but a loss will throw a significant wrench in his plans to win the league.</p>

    <p>CMGC may have just seen his playoff hopes go up in smoke after that close loss to Work Ass. He now sits at 4-7 with just a 12% chance at the playoffs. He’ll need to run the table and get some help. The good news is that he plays a weak slate down the stretch. First he gets the two worst teams in the league in the Gorlock and Senior AI Coke and then he finishes the year with The Jackson Brownes, who just lost Michael Penix for the year. It’s a very manageable schedule for a team this talented. Luck has just not bounced his way this year. Five of his seven losses have been by single digits. Without the return of Jaxson Dart, the committee would not bet on CMGC running the table.</p>

    <p>Against all odds, Sweeney. has pulled himself up the bootstraps to field a respectable team for the stretch run of the season. Geno Smith and Cam Ward miraculously both scored in double figures this week. It’s almost as rare as completing the full menu challenge at Grubbs. Meanwhile, Tee Higgins has scored in four straight games and five of his last six. He’s due for an even bigger workload this week after Ja’Marr Chase implemented scumbag hour. Bhayshal Tuten is seeing the most carries he’s seen all year. Nico Collins is remembering how to play football at just the right time. And Trey McBride is approaching levels of dominance unseen since peak Kelce/Gronk/Jimmy Graham. For context, Trey McBride is averaging 14.9 points per game in half-PPR. That would be the 9th best season of all time per our database. Thank the gentlemen at statmuse for the table below. Other than the big three mentioned above, the only other tight end with a better season would be Todd Christensen in 1983. Christensen had a great mustache.

    <p>The committee really wanted to rank him lower, but after taking a long hard look at the other teams the committee just couldn’t justify dropping King Drake any further. Even after three straight games under 20 points, King Drake is still the QB3 in points per game on the year behind only Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. Is that generally good company to be keeping? With Dak also continuing to ball as the QB8, SDZ’s hope is that he can do enough to squeak into the playoffs and get hot. But to be honest, the committee is not optimistic about that. Ja’Marr Chase decided to disgrace the Big Three that was laying waste to the league by spitting on Jalen Ramsey. Chase is now on the trade block and lucky he’s not in prison. JK Dobbins who had been a great value for SDZ messed up his knee and is cooked for the year. Ruined. He’ll now be starting three Packers against Sweeney. this rivalry week. And see below for an update on big threes.</p>
<p>Almost unbelievable how good his big three is, right?</p>

    <p>Is this the week Bucky Irving finally returns? For weeks now, JB has been dreaming of those blissful September days when he was undefeated and could guzzle Mexican Cokes in peace. Now he’s 7-4, teetering on the edge of the playoffs even after a big win and rubbing his head nonstop. Josh Allen and Bijan Robinson reminded the masses why they’re among the highest upside plays in all of fantasy football with dominating performances on Sunday. Allen in particular was historic. For the 2nd time in the last calendar year, he threw for three touchdowns and ran for another three in the same game. No human alive has done that even once. The only other man in league history to pull it off was the famed Otto Graham. The trouble for JB is with Penix out for the year; he’s scraping the bottom of the depth barrel. He has no other QBs to play, and is already counting on low ceiling players like Bam Knight and Khalil Shakir.</p>

    <p>Stewed has had some bad luck but his team is similar to the two above him. He has a couple studs and a whole lot of mud. At 4-7 though, he’s all but cooked for the playoffs. The model gives him a 4% chance. That would require running the table and getting a whole bunch of help. Stafford and Hurts are two of the top-6 QBs so far this season. The trouble is the rest of the roster. DeVonta Smith, Derrick Henry, David Montgomery are all big names in good offenses but have not delivered. Like did you watch that disgusting slopfest of a football game on Sunday night? DeVonta had one catch. David Montgomery is essentially being used like a fat Henry Hynoski now as Jahmyr Gibbs dominates the backfield. We applaud Stewed for his draft strategy, but it has not amounted to a winning formula. Kyle Monangai and Kenneth Gainwell might be the best skill guys on this team for the rest of the year.</p>

    <p>This team is somehow 7-4 with a negative point differential after Tre Tucker saved the win against SDZ Monday night. Sean “Diddy” Tucker made the Buffalo defense look like Jefferson’s coffee table the way he was cutting lines through it. Tucker’s 33-point outburst carried Obama on a day when the rest of his non-defense and non-kicker combined for 36 points. The defensive gameplan by Obama was one of the better ones we’ve seen. A source out of Monroe even went so far as to compare it to Belichick’s game plan shutting down the Rams in the Super Bowl. Obama, like the other 7-win teams, probably needs one more win to lock up a playoff spot. He gets Art of the Deal, Ger and Life with Derrick to close out the season.</p>

    <p>After the illusion of hope by getting to 5-5 last week, Ger’s playoff chances took a tumble to 25% with the loss to Scampi. He’ll likely need to run the table to get in now. With the way his team is looking that doesn’t seem so far-fetched to the committee. Jared Goff is due to bounce back after an utterly disgusting performance in Philadelphia. Davis “Long Neck” Mills is balling out in place of CJ Stroud and is due to start for at least one more week. Meanwhile, TreVeyon “Devery” Henderson is proving that he actually does know the playbook as he’s scored five touchdowns combined in the last two outings. If DK Metcalf or Rashee Rice could pick it up, this team might be downright scary. We probably ranked him too low, but too late to change it now.</p>

Jefferson’s frustration over his lack of production boiled over on Sunday as he could repeatedly be seen muttering under his breath and cursing about the inaccurate passes from “Nine”. We’re not exactly optimistic that the performance will get better from “Nine”, so it’s likely Jefferson will provide mediocre production the rest of the season. At least this week, with some of his guys back from bye, Derrick won’t have to start two additional Vikings in Hockenson and Nailor.</p>

    <p>Gorlock the D pulled out a big win over Stewed C as Justin Fields stacked some garbage time production to get to 19.34 points. With CeeDee Lamb back healthy, this almost looks like a functional team. At 3-8 though, it’s too little too late. Gorlock will take on CMGC in rivalry week. Surprisingly, the model projects this is a 3-point spread. Beyond that, we’re getting to the point in the season where bad teams are just bad teams and there’s not much analysis the committee can do.</p>

    <p>Coke Twins continues his quest to be the first winless team in Free Chee league history. He actually put up a good fight this week, scoring triple digits for only the 2nd time all season. That stat doesn’t even make sense but it’s true. With Brock Purdy back in the lineup, it looks more like a real and perhaps might even play more like a real team. He’s projected to hit triple digits again next week as he takes on Stewed C in a battle of the former Jeffersonians. We’re not even sure this team warrants the player-by-player analysis anymore as we count at least five real humans in his lineup. Let’s see if he remembers to sub Aaron Rodgers out for Mason Rudolph.</p>
