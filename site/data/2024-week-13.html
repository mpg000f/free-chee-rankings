    <p>He just keeps on trucking. Even against a formidable opponent in Tishman this week, Derrick calmly rolled to 144 points. The only question with Derrick at this point: is he peaking too soon? The real concern here is the health of Trevor Lawrence. Some (communist propagandists most likely) have been pitching him sitting out the remainder of the year to ensure the Jags get the first pick. The committee bets Lawrence will return next week to lead Derrick to fantasy glory. Derrick of course has clinched a playoff berth.</p>

    <p>Stewed is probably pacing around Jefferson fuming that he didn’t secure the top spot. Nonetheless, we had to move him back up to 2 after he laid waste to Deserves to be Shot. Saquon dropped his nuts on Sean McVay’s forehead Sunday night to seal the deal. Stewed hasn’t officially clinched a playoff berth but the odds of him missing are so impossibly low that the algorithm is rounding his playoff odds to 100%. Not gonna lie, this team is pretty scary.</p>

    <p>Did Gorlock just get waxed? Yes. Does the committee factor it in? Marginally. With Burrow and Jim Cook on bye, we’re willing to give Gorlock a bit of a pass. As we’ve preached since these rankings started, Gorlock is sort of a 5-man team and with 2 of those men out he was always going to be cooked. He remains a serious playoff threat.

    <p>One could argue he really does deserve to be shot after the showing this week, but the committee knows better. The absence of arguably his three best players in Josh Allen, Chase Brown and Bijan Robinson left him cooked regardless of opponent this week. It almost makes you wonder if Stewed C wasted an all-time great Saquon performance against the dogshit lineup Deserves to be Shot threw out there this week.  There’s still a roughly 4% chance he misses the playoffs, but the algorithm gives Deserves the 2nd best chance of anyone to win the league at 17%. Monroe is furious.</p>

    <p>This is where it gets interesting. Piss is extremely likely to make the playoffs, but there is a semi-realistic chance he misses (~11%). He got absolutely splattered this week by the hard-charging WHERESTUA. Even still, our reports out of Bloomfield suggest he’s calm, cool and collected.

    <p>Coke Master had a bad week with only 75 points. He’s cooked without Brock, with all due respect. If Brock plays, he’s locked in for a victory in the first round of the pig-off.
