    <p>Scampi claims his team was “resting” up for the playoffs when it looked like he was about to lose to Stewed C on Sunday. Luckily, a strong showing from AJ Brown helped him pull out a win and finish 13-1. The once dominant Jonathan Taylor has gone dormant with three straight games under 100 yards and &lt;15 points. Travis Kelce had been on a tear, but looked like a blacked out Zaukas on Sunday night. And the concern level for the Mariota/Kirk strategy is increasing some. He very well might still win the title but the dominance level appears to have peaked in November. Still a strong favorite though as you’ll see when we get to the odds.</p>

    <p>Gin was motivated on Sunday after the Notre Dame snub. Rumors abound that he tried to put a random Miami fan at the Knicks game in a headlock after being on the receiving end of some chirps. Unsubstantiated rumors but the committee got a good chuckle. The snub clearly had an effect as it catapulted Gin to 143 points (2nd most in league this week) in a blowout win over Team Daniel. If Shedeur and Michael Wilson are going to play like that, this team might just rampage through the playoffs. Reports expect that Drake London will be back in the mix next week along with the return of McCaffrey and Tmac from bye.</p>

With Joe Burrow back and dealing, we fully expect Chase Brown to be a menace to society in the playoffs.

    <p>The team looked like a poor man’s version of the 2014 Arcadia baseball team, but he did enough to win and clinch the 4th seed because he was going against Mickey Mouse Inc. (Senior AI Coke). There might be a discussion to be had if Jacoby Brissett is the QB1 on this team now? Mahomes has a rotating cast of obese slobs attempting to block for him right now while his receivers are determined to turn dimes into bobbled interceptions. Since Brissett took over as the full-time starter in week 6, he is averaging 21.1 points per game while Mahomes is averaging 20.5 points per game over the same timeframe. Brissett is a king. Gibbs, meanwhile, glided through a depleted Dallas defense for another 33.5 points and after them game was quoted as saying “Light work. Those pussies can’t guard me.”</p>

    <p>Remember when JB was talking all that shit in September? Through sheer grit, intuition and the best trio in the world, SDZ was able to finish ahead of him in the regular season standings. Drake “Drake Maye” Maye was on bye and SDZ still took down Ger to finish with the 3rd seed. Tony Pollard spent much of the season playing like Sweeney in high school, but it appears he is activating beast mode for the playoffs after running all over the Browns defense. Christian Watson is starting to look like a true WR1 in Green Bay, with five touchdowns in the last four weeks.

<div class="special-section matchup-section"><h2>Playoff Preview</h2><h3 class="matchup-header">Scampi (1) vs. Work Ass (8)</h3><p>Some are calling this the de facto championship. The teams 1st and 3rd in points for face off in a colossal first round clash. Yahoo’s model has this as a 50-50 proposition. Our model favors Scampi a bit, but it remains far from a lock. X-factors: Jonathan Taylor and Rome Odunze. Taylor is the #1 running back in the league so how can he be an x-factor right? Well without Daniel Jones and Riley Leonard unavailable, Taylor might be running into a brick wall against Seattle’s defense. If that happens, Scampi’s recipe might be cooked. For Work Ass, Odunze has been scrambled ass for the past month. To advance to the semifinals, he’ll likely need Odunze to play like he did in September. Pick: Work Ass pulls the upset.</p><h3 class="matchup-header">Ginny Sack (2) vs. Team OBAMA SOPRANOS (7)</h3><p>Big Gin is a heavy favorite this week in a major contrast of roster construction. Obama is relying heavily on the Lamar-Burrow duo while Gin slapped together a Shedeur-Shough QB room to pair with a plethora of skill talent. Our model gives Gin a 73% chance to advance. Can Obama give one of his patented speeches to motivate the troops? X-factors: Kimani Vidal and Michael Wilson. Even with Omarion Hampton back in the lineup, Vidal saw a lot of touches on Monday night. Obama will need that to continue if he has any hope of generating enough RB production to take down Scampi. Michael Wilson has essentially turned into Jerry Rice in the past three games Marvin Harrison Jr doesn’t play. Harrison’s status for week 15 is up in the air and that will be a big factor for Gin. Pick: Madam Sack takes care of business.</p><h3 class="matchup-header">Sweeney Deez and Zaukas (3) vs. Art of the Deal (6)</h3><p>This is one of the more intriguing matchups of the first round and that’s reflected in the ticket prices. The average ticket price for this matchup is $345 compared to $177 across the other three playoff matchups. Some have hypothesized that people want to the future MVP Drake Maye, but the committee’s research suggests that people are dying to see Nine in person. Coming off his strongest game as a pro, Nine’s confidence is sky high and he feels like he can lead Art to the title. Despite being the higher seed, SDZ is actually a slight underdog here. X-factors: Tony Pollard and Darren Waller. After being dormant for much of the season, Pollard popped off for 28 points this week. That’s the type of explosiveness SDZ will need to make a playoff run. With Waller working his way back in the lineup, Art really needs him to revert to early season form. Pick: Art exacts revenge for last year and starts his playoff run.</p><h3 class="matchup-header">Pigs on the 7th Rank (4) vs. The Jackson Brownes (5)</h3><p>Longtime nemeses meet again. The injury to Zach Ertz has Pigs scrambling to find a suitable tight end replacement (probably Cade Otton). Meanwhile, JB is going to need some hero-level performances from Josh Allen and Bijan. Yahoo’s model favors JB, but the committee’s model favors Pigs. There’s potentially some solid arbitrage you can get on this betting line if you shop around to the different books. The main criticism of Pigs comes down to Patrick Mahomes. That Sunday night performance was among the grossest of his career, and it came at the absolute worst time for Pigs. X-factors: Nobody. Pick: Pigs on the 7th wins a shootout as Allen, Bijan, Gibbs and Brissett all go for a million.</p></div>
<div class="special-section matchup-section"><h2>Second Round</h2><h3 class="matchup-header">Team Daniel (10) vs. Life with Derrick (14)</h3><p>Derrick coaches the team up and coaxes one great game out of Justin Jefferson to pair with well-timed explosions from CJ Stroud and Bryce Young. Pick: Derrick Stewed C (12) vs. Senior AI Coke Twins (16) Stewed C takes out his Eagles frustrations on Senior Coke in an absolute blowout sending Senior Coke to the final in his quest for eternal infamy (0-17). Pick: Stewed C</p></div>
<div class="special-section matchup-section"><h2>Final Round</h2><h3 class="matchup-header">Team Daniel (10) vs. Senior AI Coke Twins (16)</h3><p>Team Daniel takes care of business. Senior Coke goes 0-17 and agrees not to touch bag for six months. Pick: Team Daniel</p></div>
<div class="special-section matchup-section"><h2>Relegation Preview</h2><h3 class="matchup-header">Ger (9) vs. Senior AI Coke Twins (16)</h3><p>Free win for Ger. Cokemaster might not set lineup and Ger has some legitimately solid talent in his lineup now. His running back room and Rashee Rice will carry the day. Pick: Ger Team Daniel (10) vs. Gorlock the Destroyer Schartz (15) With his QB injuries, Team Daniel is reeling. Gorlock has steadily been gaining steam to build for this moment. This is where he puts it all together (mostly Love and Amon-Ra pop off) and he steals the victory. Pick: Gorlock Cookie Monster Golf Cart (11) vs. Life with Derrick (14) CMGC has a top four team in the league and got cooked with bad luck and injuries. He takes care of business to give him ample time to regroup and start planning for next year’s draft. Pick: CMGC Stewed C (12) vs. Sweeney. (13) This matchup is actually two decent teams. We were mostly pretty optimistic about Stewed C for much of the year, but then we watched Jalen Hurts play on Monday night. The nutjobs calling into Philly radio stations saying it’s time to start Tanner McKee might have a point. Pick: Sweeney.</p></div>
